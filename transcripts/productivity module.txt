How is it going, you guys? One of the biggest things that I have new creators ask me is how is your creative process look? How are you filming videos? You know, how are you coming up with ideas? All this sort of stuff, right? And a lot of this will go hand in hand with my Frankenstein method for 80-20ing and also my Malvi method 80-20ing module, which you should have seen already. If not, go back and watch those, or watch it after this, doesn't matter. But I think that as a creator, if you don't have a solid, productive, creative process, you are going to fail.

That's just my opinion. If you can't find yourself that flow, you are just not going to be successful because what's gonna happen is you're gonna lose your creative balance. You're gonna lose your creative ability, really.

What's gonna happen is you're gonna get burnt out, it's gonna feel like a job, and you're gonna lose that love that you have for it. There is ways, there's different methods of going about your creative process. I'm gonna tell you about all of them that I know of because I have tried all of them, and I'm gonna tell you exactly what works for me.

You may have something that works for you, and that's great, but I want you to try each of these three different ones, right? So in terms of actually scripting, so I drew script now, but here's one thing, here's the three things you could do. No script, so we'll say off the dome. You could go full script or partial script.

And I'm gonna tell you the advantages and disadvantages to each one of these here. So honestly, when I started out, I was right here. And this is strange because I was doing my personal content for my personal brand, I was fully scripted.

So I don't know why I did no script, I think maybe it was to sound more organic. I don't really know what the appeal was for me, but that's what I was doing. Completely off the dome, just taking it piece by piece.

I was using my tabs on my iPhone, going back to TikTok, watching the first cut that they made, 80-20ing each little cut, essentially. Which may have took a little bit of time, honestly, but it's still way shorter than scripting the whole thing out. And what that was able to do for me is I was able to have max creative output, because I was on the spot.

So one thing I want you to understand about being a creator and sounding organic is anything you can do to make it feel like you're in a conversation with somebody, the more organic it's gonna feel. Because whenever you're in a conversation with somebody, are you following a script in what you're saying? Maybe if you're doing sales calls, but in your regular conversations with your family or your friends, because that's the vibe that you're trying to create with these TikToks, it's off the dome. And you have to be able to create, and that's what really gives you that natural tonality, that natural pacing.

And that's not something you can really replicate. You can try really hard, and maybe you're an animal and you can. But no scripting is definitely an idea, and I think it works for people.

I definitely was able to cook a considerable amount of money doing this, however I have or find it. So what happened is, after I was doing this no script era, I fell into this period where I got really, really locked in on this TikTok shit. And I was like, I should be scripting everything.

I need to go ahead and write out my full scripts, every single word I'm gonna say, because I wanna carefully calculate. And I'm gonna go into how this actual creative process looks but it's important for me to discuss these scripting options first, so you can figure it out for yourself. But I was scripting everything.

And I like to say I'm a pretty good actor. I think I can make my way around. But what that was doing is it made things really mechanical in a way.

It made things really robotic, artificial in a way. Because no matter how hard I tried, I was still referencing back to the script every single time I followed a sentence to say pretty much exactly how I wrote it out. Because I was like, I spent so much time crafting this exact sentence, I need to say it like this.

Which, maybe it might work for you. So I'm not saying you shouldn't try it. But for me, just did not come out organic, no matter how hard I tried.

And so this is why my final conclusion that I came to is a partial script. So what I'll do is I'll write out either the start of the sentence or I'll write out sometimes just even the ideas. Sometimes I'll just put like, talk about how your girlfriend lost X amount of weight in X amount of time with the product.

Talk about how, then go into how you drink your Beaumont, this is with a brand that I was doing yerba mate powder with. I would just write down those general concepts. And maybe the hook, if it was like something I really needed to remember, I would write out hook about Luigi Mangione or something like that.

And then, but sometimes I'll write out the actual words. But what I started to do is instead of saying that exactly, I would get an idea for what is the sentence that I'm supposed to say here. And then I wouldn't try to remember it exactly.

I would just off the top of my head, say what I wanted to say about that and say it how I wanted to say to give you that natural delivery. So partial script has by far been the least stressful because I'm not sitting there for six hours scripting my videos. Usually it takes me about two hours to script my videos and then maybe a one hour to film on each filming day.

And so yeah, this has been the most productive for me. Maybe you're different though. I want you to try these different styles.

So along with this, how does this work for me? So I have a two day sequence. I guess it's a four day sequence, I guess you could say. This is how I do it.

I will script all my videos in the morning on that day. So I like to script out my videos for the next two days, three days, including that day that I'm scripting. So I'll have that first day, I'm scripting my videos.

Usually takes me about two hours to film one per day per brand. Sometimes it takes longer from doubling up on videos, but that's different. So let's say I have two brands, right? I'm scripting six videos for the next three days, including that day.

I'm filming those six videos. And then I edit the first video for each brand for that day that I finished filming. Okay, it's important to remember this.

The next day, I go ahead and I edit the rest of them for that day and the next day. And then I'll take that next day fully off. So what that does is it allows me full creative ability for scripting and filming.

And then that next day, it's a fresh day. It allows me full creative ability to edit because both are important. Scripting and filming is much more important though.

So then I'll have one day off. I don't like, I've tried to do like four days in advance and then take two days off. Honestly, you're gonna burn yourself out.

I mean, that's my opinion. Maybe you have so much time on your hands. I don't, I have kids, I have all this going on.

For me, this is the best thing that I have found. I know that people like Beans. He scripts and films and edits his video one per day on the same day, every single day.

What's gonna happen is honestly, you could get to a point where you just start hating your life if you're like trying to do so many batches over time. Trust me, I've gone through that and it's just not very feasible. But so I think with the scripting process, it's very important to be able to make it as fast as possible.

And maybe you don't script at all. Maybe you're going straight off the dome and that could work for you too. Full scripting, if it works for you, go for it.

But I think that will take up so much of your time. That's just not necessary and sometimes can lead it to being more, less organic. I think it is important though when you're starting out, maybe script it fully out, but then freestyle how you say each line.

That might be the ticket. So that way you can get the framework down, you can get the everything down in terms of structure. But yeah, so that is my productivity flow.

You can see right here, this is an example of one of my scripts right here. And I would loosely follow this. So I wrote out this right here.

So along with this creative process that I do, a way that I 80-20 honestly is I'll go ahead and take the script of the video that I wanna 80-20. I will go into TalkScript, I will paste the video URL. It'll feed me that script right here.

I'll literally copy paste it right into a Google document. And then I will edit a few words here and there just to make it have continuity with my brand that I'm working with. This was for Boom Boom.

I made it work for these Yerba Magic stick packs. And then I won't say this exactly how it is. So that's how I'll even 80-20 even further, make it even more mine.

So name something that feels illegal, but it's not, I'll go first. These little Yerba Magic stick packs. So I wouldn't read this exactly how it is.

I'll get the general idea, I'll kind of skim over it. And then I would say, you know, I would just restyle. I would go, tell me something that seems illegal, but it's not, I'm gonna go first.

These Yerba Magic stick packs. Oh my fucking God, what do they put in these? That's a terrible example, that sounded really inorganic. But I'm just giving you an example of like going off the script from your memory.

That is my creative process. With a lot of videos, I will literally take a script that's already worked, I'll plug a few things in, and I will, and this saves me so much time, so much time. If it's a structure that's already worked, feel free to do this, because then you'll just cut where you need to cut, reference back, and on the fly, figure out things that you can say differently.

That is my creative process, literally. So keep it simple, don't make it too complicated, but make sure that you prioritize your productivity so that you don't lose that creative fire. Because as a creator, that's everything for you.

That's everything. So make sure that you can keep that alive. There's another example right here, took another video.

So yeah, that's essentially my creative process. It's as simple as that, guys. I hope that helps somebody out there who's struggling to find their flow, so that you can also take those days off, because it's not, you shouldn't be working, I mean, honestly, if you wanna work every day and just do one video a day, that's fine, but I like to have a day off.

So if you didn't see how you could have a day off if you have to post every day, this is how you have a day off. And I hope that helps somebody. So thank you, guys.
