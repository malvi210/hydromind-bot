What is going on party people? This is a module that has came up in my discussions in my one-on-one calls And you know people will always tell you to sound like a friend, you know We get that part of content creation people always tell you like talk like you're on facetime But nobody seems to talk about this concept right here And this is something that I began to realize in my personal page where I talk about religion a lot You kind of want to there's this aspect of social media every single post That has gone viral literally ever You'll notice that Maybe 20 percent of the comments are actually for the creator of the video The other 80 of those comments are people conversating amongst each other About said topic about whatever the niche may be Okay And why is this important? your video Needs to be creating a forum for that discussion to be created um, it's it's A critical aspect of social media that whenever you're going on social media you find an experience where you feel Like you're a part of something You know, you feel like you're you're a part of a community. It's really special When you scroll past a tiktok that's hitting you just right to where you open up that comment section and you see Oh, this is my people Um, and what does that do? They trust you more As the creator Subconsciously because you've created this space whether it was intentional or not and um Also, it becomes a whole experience, you know It moves them a lot more because then they can read comments about all these other people talking about how their journey with um Hair loss or their journey with their dog suffering or their journey with weight loss, whatever it may be They're able to live through their stories as well vicariously so your job As a creator is to create this forum this place where uh, People can uh be heard, you know, they can have conversation about these terrible ailments They're experiencing and it'll greatly build trust Okay You can also kind of use it in a controversial way if you can create a topic of discussion. That's something to argue about Um, not super recommended though because it may not convert as well so that's something that we do see a lot of as well if it gets too controversial it won't but Could keep that in mind too because we can create a little bit of controversy. 

It can work in your favor It has worked for my personal page. Uh, and I wasn't intending to do it, but it did happen. So Uh, I just think this is a very important aspect of what it means to be a content creator Um because you need to remember We're not doing ugc. 

This is organic Tiktok, uh marketing so that means you're not gonna Have ad spin behind your videos. Sometimes we'll do ad spin, you know, like these brands and cc But most of the time you're not gonna have ad spin behind your videos and you can't rely on ad spin to push Your video to the correct audience so your job is to Immerse yourself within this pool of people Who share the similar experience of the avatar that you're trying to service with the product or with the pain point And so what that means is you have to develop an engaging enough story So that you can also lead others to feel vulnerable enough to share theirs and you can build an entire community Um your community building as a creator as well. You're not just a salesperson. 

So remember that first very very important aspect of content
