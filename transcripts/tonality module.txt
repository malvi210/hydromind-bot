What's going on y'all? So I put this title in Cosmic Sands just because for the memes but in having calls with you guys I've recognized that a lot of you are struggling with tonality and as a creator like this is one of the biggest things that I guess with shop content it's hard I think for people to once you get the tonality down I think a lot of other stuff follows right it's a huge piece of content but shop content especially because you can't apply the same tonality rules that you apply to regular content to shop content this is a totally different thing you have the sales aspect involved and so I'm not going to try to make this video too long but I kind of want to summarize the notes that I had with some of y'all that did do a call with me so that the rest of you can hear it as well if you didn't book a call but so yeah this is something that I struggle with too I think that you know especially whenever you get excited maybe you're having like good momentum with sales or maybe you're just not having good momentum and so you're really trying to put in the extra work you kind of tend to go more to the up speak because you think it's going to be more engaging right so what I mean by up speak is like are you listening to what I'm saying don't you think this is crazy look at this next clip all that like going up with your speech every single time it can work in a content frame right like it's the influencer accent and I think that's what a lot of us kind of go back to as doing content we become so familiar with that but people are catching on to that in content already and they're also catching on to and they're definitely catching on to it with shop content because there's that extra element once again it's psychological there's that extra element you're trying to sell them something and so you guys need to sound as organic as possible I know you guys hear all the time like it's like you're facetiming a friend I know you hear these things but I want to reframe it for you guys in a different way that maybe it makes more sense because buying these calls I thought of this stuff so one thing I think is super powerful that I do have down here is you can record yourself doing an actual reaction to different topics that are actually going on right now so something that makes you afraid something that makes you mad something that makes you sad record yourself actually reacting to those things you don't have to post these obviously but any topic that makes you passionate record yourself and how you naturally react to that and study that and really try to get back into that space for whenever you're making a video on something that's supposed to make the person feel scared or makes you feel scared or supposed to make them feel sad or makes you feel sad go back to that place and the reason this is so so valuable y'all different people have completely different reactions to the exact same piece of tonality goes so much deeper than just creating this image for the viewer it is you it is you you have a very unique tonality to you and so anything you can do to find your tonality is so so valuable and I don't think I'll have people talk about this like you have a very unique tonality to you so you need to see exactly how you react the the very minute inflections that you do be insane about it obsess over tonality is very important because if I can sense in any way that you're not being authentic with me I am not going to care so that's one aspect of it and then the other aspect of it is going to be pacing okay along with your tonality you also need to be pacing correctly um and this is something I struggle with too a lot but you can also do the same thing by studying how you speak whenever you're talking about something you're passionate about but another thing that's honestly way better for pacing that I did put down here is have a loved one record your natural tonality and pacing when you're not aware so tell them like when I don't know that you're recording record me speaking so that I can go back and I can study exactly how I pace myself when I speak exactly how fast they go how slow I go because this is another thing people have a very natural tonality and they also have their own unique natural pacing and this is something that I struggle with a lot I can show you guys an example of my tonality was okay in this video because I was going up and then I was going back down like how I normally do in my speech so I didn't really touch on that but in your normal everyday speech most people whenever it's a word that they're supposed to be emphasis on they'll go up on that word and then they'll come back down to close out the sentence they're adding closure right that's just the natural flow of conversation so I was doing that pretty decent in this video which I will point out when we actually look at it so you have a real example but then pay attention to my pacing because it's not the same as me speaking to you right now in my actual pacing right now so listen lady has been able to look 20 years younger than she actually is for such a long time everybody knows this and she so so when I said such a long time everybody knows this I did the natural up speak and then I came back down that's good but you notice how I did this weird pause right here this fucking lady has been able to look 20 years younger than she has been able to look 20 years younger that's weird why am I doing that no idea I had my buddy beans point that out to me and I'm so grateful that is not normal pacing okay so pacing is very important too because that's also going to flag somebody for your video not being organic for it not being actually what you think not actually what you feel because you're trying to put a certain persona on the screen on in their face you're trying to portray a certain idea and it's not actually your own and people are going to be able to feel that even if not on the super conscious level they're going to be able to know that subconsciously and so you have to really become obsessed with this aspect I'm telling y'all so many other things will follow with your content if you can nail this shit so what you can do also is you can study people on tiktok that aren't doing shop videos and are actually reacting really to certain situations so you can see this is a good story time right here if you're running any skincare angle but you can also modify this I wish I could think of more videos but this is the one that I thought of because I'm running evil good skincare at the time of this recording and I've used this clip for green screen whatever but this is an actual reaction of her being pissed off because of her dermatologist like overcharging her all that stuff so listen to how she speaks in this and the natural pacing the natural tonality all that she's like it's like she's speaking to a friend office and I'm at checkout right mind you I usually pay 70 or 80 dollars per visit per month just to get this shit checked out I go out tell me why they said 110 and nobody was gonna call see how she went um to get this shit checked out tell me why they said 110 you said she went up she went down natural but continue and tell me and let me know hey we've increased for acne visits we've increased our charges 30 to 40 dollars that was again roughly I don't have insurance that covers any of my meds so that's already out of pocket I was a college student see that natural flow is going up on the words that you find emphasis on and then going back down but you can feel how she's natural like it's very organic because it is so if you can study where people are actually upset they're actually moved and you can study how you're actually upset how you're actually moved whatever that looks like for you it will take your content so much further so lastly I want to show you guys beans because he's a freaking goat and this is a dude that helped me with a lot of this stuff in my own content and hear how he has this very natural and it's really weird like if you get if you talk to this guy actually like I did he's have the exact same in his content as he does in real life and that's how you want to be but just watch this I said shit like this y'all need this when this fucking guy says shit like this y'all need to start paying attention I said no no I'm not kidding when this fucking guy says shit like this y'all need to start paying attention see what I mean up down up down like shit like this it's because it's an important emphasis shit like this yeah you get it you don't have to they wouldn't have any been telling us to get like three days ago but they have been telling us to get ready for the grid to go down what are you gonna do when you wake up and you have no power you can't turn on the tv no radio don't know what's going on in the world you're gonna do when you wake up and your phone doesn't work can't get a call your phone doesn't work you see what I mean it's like a very natural flow so if y'all can tap into that like natural flow of the up speak and then the down speak whenever it's necessary it'll take y'all so much further so like I said I wanted to keep this kind of short but I've noticed that this is a huge problem with a lot of the creators that I'm trying to help right now and so I just wanted to put this in a little short video so that you guys can refer back to it and for y'all those of you who did not book a call you can go back and watch this uh too because I think it's super valuable and especially if y'all really sit down and do this right here I think it'll be so much sauce for you personally find that 20% when you're 80 20 the 20% is you find what that 20% means and you will be a true creator so that's it y'all much love
