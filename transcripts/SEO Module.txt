Ladies and gentlemen, how we doing? This is yet another loom module for you guys at your head top. I am on a mission to create the most saucy modules for you guys as possible, all while using the Comic Sans infamous font that is very meme-y and very unappealing for the eyes. So today we're gonna be talking about SEO or search engine optimization.

And the reason I got the idea to make this video is because I actually currently hold the most relevant video for this product right here. This is Yerba Magic sold by Breenista. So if you go on TikTok right now, by the time you see this video, it probably still will be like this.

If you go on TikTok right now, you go ahead and search up Yerba Magic in your search bar right here, bada bing, bada boom, it's gonna be the first video that pops up. Why is this significant? Because people are going to see this product and a lot of times when people see this product on another affiliate's video, they're gonna search it up to find more information on it, okay? So there's a few different factors that are gonna play into why this video has been so effective for me. But I will tell you that since I posted this video in December, it is still consistently pumping me out 2K GMV days.

So I have consistently made at least $5,000 a month with this video, if not 10, I think it's been 10 every single month. So this is very important to understand this factor. It doesn't mean that you have to do this to a T with every single video and optimize it, but it is an important tool in your tool belt that you should be cognizant of.

So I will say with full transparency, when I made this video, I didn't actually intend for it to be so popular and so relevant in the search engine, but in retrospect, I can understand why that is. So let's just break down some very simple tactics for SEO firstly. So I will say that I got a lot of these ideas from Clint who is in the server, the Creators Corner server as well.

If you guys don't know him, he's a very popular, he's very successful. I believe he's done 100K months. He cooked with Roos Research, previously Roos Research and now CataCore.

So very organic talking head content, very, very great creator. So this is something that he does in his videos a lot. So essentially, this is one thing that you can do.

You can add search terms that are relevant to the product or relevant to the pain points that you are addressing. So say it's for Yerba Magic, yeah? What you can do, because we were on the weight loss angle, is you can do things like, well, this is actually a little bit tricky. With weight loss, you wanna stay away from using directly related terms, but say it is NAD, yeah? Let's do anti-aging, okay? Let's do stay young.

I don't know, these are just examples here. Wrinkles, yeah? Eye bags, things like this, things that everybody that you're associated, your associated avatar, everything that they would be looking at, they would be interested in. So what you ideally wanna do with each product is take these same search terms, keep them in notes on your phone or whatever, copy and paste them into every single one of your videos, and then go ahead and, so do it in actual text format, and then go ahead and slide the text over off the screen to where you can't see it, because it will still be embedded in it, and it can play into the actual search engine optimization, okay? Another thing is your caption, anything that you say in the video, anything that is in your title.

So there is different factors here. So if we look at a few others that did pop up on the search engine here, eating, there's a few words that I saw in this one right here GLP-1, increase energy, less brain fog. I think that's why these slideshows go so viral too.

It's a big factor because you see a lot of these key search terms in it. All right? Okay, guys, but to get on with why this video did so well, in my opinion, is because firstly, it does have a lot of this key stuff. So it's a very bottom of funnel video to begin with.

You can see Yerba Magic immediately. And so that does play into it. I also do have in my hashtags here, I have Yerba Mate, Yerba Magic, which isn't completely essential, but immediately I am talking about Yerba Magic.

It's like very evident. I have, it's very almost bottom of funnel. So that is great.

But then what initially pushed this video to success is it is talking about it being a scam. So you have two factors at play here, yeah? It's not just a normal video that got pushed to the top of the search engine because I'm using very direct terminology and I'm talking about the product itself. It's very product focused.

The other aspect to it is it has this scam alert in it. So another thing that usually happens is people go to look up Yerba Magic scam, you know? And look at that, scam alert is actually one of the first things that's there as well. So you see all these videos that are here, it pops up right here, not scammers, but let me see here.

If you do scam, it should come up as well. Yep, there it is. So a lot of people, whenever they see a product, they don't know if they should trust it or not.

They're gonna go looking up that with scam behind it so they can see if it is. They're gonna see this video right here. They're gonna click on this video because that's what they're looking for.

They're gonna get reeled in because it's like dramatic. I'm talking about with a very convicting tonality about how I'm being scammed by these people. And I have them reeled in and then I start dumping these benefits on their head.

And they're like, oh wait, why is he, you know, why is he talking about it being a scam if it has these amazing benefits, all this? Then I tell them she purchased from a scam listing. And then I'm creating this fear in them that, so they want the product because they want these amazing benefits. That's why they looked up this product to see if it's a scam.

Then they're seeing that there's all these scam listings. And then they see me saying, you need to make sure you're getting from the correct listing. I link the video here, bada bing, bada boom.

I get the kill. I bring the food home for the family and we feast, yeah? But these are the different factors that do contribute to my video. Now I'm not saying go out and make a scam alert video.

Here's another one that actually comes up. Oh, this is somebody that sold my video. Either way, this is just showing you these factors that led to the search engine optimization, okay? There's different ways that you can play into it.

The main purpose of this video is making you aware of these factors. Because if you at least have some idea of this in your videos, while you're still being creative, you can maybe start to implement some of these ideas. The important thing is that you're aware of this.

Because if you are able to basically force all of the traffic to come to you, you're taking essentially all this money from other affiliates. And that's what I've been doing for the past four, five months with this video. It's actually insane.

So I just want you guys to be aware of this. This is something that you should be thinking of. And I don't ever like to give you guys strict rules because it's gonna be very different for everybody.

But just to show you how powerful this is, guys, and how well this converts because people are going and they're already interested in the product, this video has 1.3 million views. And as I'm checking yesterday, it has 160,000 GMV. So I don't even know how many sales that is, but usually it's something like every 10,000 views it gets, I'm getting 50 sales.

So it's absolutely absurd. Yeah, guys, so just be aware of that, have it in your tool belt, because if you can find a way to hack the traffic in the same way as I've done here, you're going to create very sustainable income for yourself from the same video. It will feed you literally for months.

Very important to be aware of, guys.
