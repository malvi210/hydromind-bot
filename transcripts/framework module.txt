How's it going, you guys? One of the big things that I noticed with new creators is that you guys really struggle with framework, okay? So I have a few other modules that you will probably have seen already, or you may be seeing soon, depending on when I intend to release these in what order. Framework is by far one of the biggest things that will kill you as a creator. You could have all the other pieces, right? You could have the great tonality, the great pacing.

You could have a great storyline, but if you don't structure that correctly, it is not going to have that same emotional impact. And if you guys know me at all, you know that I prioritize the emotions that you're creating in the viewer whenever they're watching your video, because that is what you should be prioritizing in any form of art, because video creation is an art form. And I have another thing that I wanna touch on that in a minute here.

But overall, you need to understand that your video must have continuity. Okay, what does that mean? Each section of the video, if you're doing cuts, if you're doing clips, no matter what style you're running, it should be easy to follow. This should be easy enough for me to give it to an eight-year-old and them to be able to understand what's going on.

If you're starting out with a CTA, if you're starting out in the middle of your story, if you're jumping around from the middle of your story to the beginning of your story, backtracking to explain some further context, that is going to lose the integrity of the continuity of your video. And that is critically important because you need to understand people's brains are shut off by the time they're watching TikTok at night. After they get off of work, understand what mind frame they're in.

You need to be talking to a second grader whenever you're making these videos. And that goes along with the vocabulary you're using, but it definitely goes along with the framework and how you structure that framework. So main important thing here is it needs to have continuity.

And if you guys are new to my modules here, I do this in Comic Sans as a meme. So I hope that it straightens your eyes. If you don't know what I'm talking about, maybe you're not big in internet meme culture and I sound dumb.

Anyways, so along with that, let me go ahead and show you some different examples. I will show you firstly, so I have a few notes here. The basis of pretty much every good framework, you can break it down into three parts, right? Hook, body, and CTA.

That is essentially the very basic bare bones structure to how your video should be looking. Now, as a creator, you can be flexible with the different ways that you want to extrapolate upon this beginning structure, okay? So one of these big things that I also see creators struggle with, which I've made a separate module for, as well as product intro. Your product intro should fit somewhere within that body.

You can do it in the beginning of the video, after you've done the hook and introduced a little bit of backstory, or you can do it after you've done all of the story as that beacon of hope. Both are just as effective, but you have to understand what type of creator you are and how you really want to develop that plot, right? Because you can very easily, as we're gonna look, there is so many successful creators that introduce the product very, very early. And depending on the type of creator you are, that can be more lethal.

Because what it's doing is it's creating that familiarity and you're able to expand on why that product is useful. And then also, you're able to mini sell them throughout the entire video because they've already seen the product. Now, on the other side, it may be more impactful for you as a creator, depending on your style, to take them through that entire emotional journey first, to the end, to where they're begging for you to introduce that product.

So it's all just gonna depend on what way that you want to hit it. And I will say, I have done both before and both have performed well for me. So it's going to test your ability to be different and make different things work as a creator.

Versatility, that's the word I was looking for. But essentially, once you learn these same core principles, you can kind of apply it all throughout. So every video needs to have great continuity.

I like this analogy of thinking of your video like it's a song. So how does every good song look, right? You have that buildup. You have the initial thing that makes them wanna stay and listen to the song.

It's creating this tension, you wanna release, right? Then you have your initial hook that's really tied them in. And I like to think of this part like really developing your storyline here. Then you have the climax of the video.

And in our case here, that's gonna be the product intro. Then you're gonna have a breakdown and you're gonna maybe reinforce it again. So play your hook or your chorus again in the song and that's gonna be your CTA.

And then you're gonna have either an outro or it's gonna kind of end there depending on what kind of music you listen to or whatever. That is an analogy I really like because once again, this is a form of art and every art follows a similar structure. So once you can really start to understand what makes people tick, you will be so successful in every creative venture and it's amazing this opportunity that we have to be able to utilize our creativity to make us generational wealth.

So if you can kind of get in that mind frame of how much bigger this is than just silly little TikToks, this is art. You are figuring out how to generate certain emotions within the person that you are serving in order to move them to perform a certain action. And it is insane when you really think about it.

That is how you need to, and you need to be dedicated to this. You need to understand that every little moving piece is very important. So the most important thing as well with product intro is make sure that you walk them through the pain before you CTA them.

So you can have your product intro early in the video in the start of the body, that's fine. But you need to walk them through the pain again before you give the final CTA. This is what I call taking your foot off the gas.

And this is an important phrase. I haven't heard anyone else mention it. Maybe they have and maybe I just took it from somewhere, either way.

Very important to understand this concept. So I'm gonna give you guys tangible explanations by actually watching through two different styles. So in this video here, we will see a early product intro.

And then in this video here, you will see a later product intro. So let's, and we wanna be studying the overall framework as well as we're going through. I'm gonna let it play through and then talk about it after.

You are taking that shot that makes you go like that. Guess what? You don't need to do that anymore. I found something that's completely natural, cheap, tastes delicious.

And it worked so hard that I literally have to eat before I take it or else I won't be able to eat the rest of the day. Okay, it's literally nature's Zempik, okay? Right here, right here. I'm telling you right now, I was not prepared for this, okay? I had, my sister-in-law was taking it and she just had two babies and literally like is smaller than I am.

And I could not believe how quick it happened. And she was like, oh yeah, I take like, it's like a natural Zempik. And I was like, okay, guys, like not only does it do that, it will make you just glow from within.

It's got like all this stuff for gut health. And then more than anything else, guess what? I stopped taking my focus medicine. Like, I don't know why, like it's got L-theanine in it.

So I'm wondering if that's what it is. And it's got some different nootropics in it, but holy smokes, like if you need to glow up or you need extra focus or some gut health. Okay, so, and then she goes into the final CTA, right? Creating that urgency, but look at this.

I want you guys to notice how she introduced the product. I literally have to eat the rest of the day, okay? It's literally nature's Zempik, okay? So she introduces the product right here. I'm telling you right now, I was not prepared.

And immediately she takes her foot off the gas. She said, I will tell you, I was not prepared for this. Okay, I had my sister.

She immediately goes back to that storyline and this is what you need to note. If you're doing an early product intro, that's totally fine, but you need to understand how to take your foot off the gas and reinforce these ideas in their head. Walk them through that journey again because you'll notice that's immediately what Michaela does here.

And then she's going more into her personal story about glowing from within, all this kind of thing. She gives a brief education here as well and then she goes into the final CTA. If you need a glow up or need extra focus or some good health, this is your all-in-one.

It's on a big flash sale right now. Create that urgency, boom, closed. So this is an example of an early product intro and then I'll now show you an example of a later product intro right here.

This random geezer discover why people are getting ugly. Listen to what she says, especially if you have kids. You know, like mouth breathers, you know some people have a bit, they just have to breathe out of their mouth or like I named it and it changes the form.

It does. Of their jaws. It changes the jaw, the roof of the mouth drops.

A whole lot of horrible things. When you nose breathe, opens up the little canals at the back. Wow, and then does that allow more oxygen to be getting to your brain? Yep, yep, the whole thing.

80% more oxygen gets into the cell. You know, sleep apnea and snoring would just about be a thing of the past. Not just geezers that understand this, modern medicine is catching on.

These people, they're mouth breathers. They can also change their face shape. Yes, there's one case of this young girl who just got a pet hamster, I think it was, got the allergy to the hamster and later took this beautiful young girl and she just, her face just starts aging at a rapid rate.

They get rid of the hamster, she goes back to nasal breathing and like her, these beautiful, almost like. Okay, so you notice how in this one here, he has, we have the storyline in the body right here that's being developed, right? And it has that continuity to it. The only difference between each video here, I think you guys tend to think, or just people in general tend to think that this is totally different like because there are different styles.

It's definitely not. Each storyline is creating its own like, each storyline is delivering those same emotions, right? So although it's a talking head right here, she's developing a certain set of emotions. You know, that longing for a change of people.

Here, he's developing, you know, this. Allergy to the hamster. It's got this educational appeal.

Struggled with this for years. And then he goes into his own storyline again. Watch their reaction.

Tropical rush is our best seller. And then he shows this story right here of this like amazing product. This is where the product has been introed.

Really good. Keeps them open. Fortunately, when people have congestion or $12 a pop.

Booms are all natural in this combo. And he even does the take the foot off the gas too, even though he is like doing it later in the video, right? Thinus is up and it keeps them open. You just unscrew the cap.

Slight education, which I think is important. Have slight education, but not too much towards the end of the video. And then you close them.

Boom, got the kill. But I hope that this short little module right here can help you guys to understand how frameworks look a little bit better and why it's important for them to be in a certain way. Because yeah, just overall, think about a story, right? If you're watching a movie, how would you be moved emotionally if it's just jumping all over the place all the time? You know what I mean? This is something that you guys need to understand if you are gonna be a successful creator.

So I hope that this helped. Feel free to hit me up in your coaching chat if you have any questions. Thank you guys so much.
