What's going on, my lovely ladies and gentlemen. So, a core pillar of a successful shop career is product intro. And this goes hand in hand with conversions.

And if you haven't watched my conversion little module, I suggest that you go back and watch that one because I do like that one. But I'm trying to make these shorter for you guys so it's like easier to watch, right? So, another thing I noticed in doing calls with you guys is your product intro feels so forced. It's like, you can have a great video, they stay watching until that very part, but if you mess this up, it's not gonna convert.

And so, let's go over main guidelines, right? First, we'll go over the do nots because this is what I want you to hear first, okay? Do not sound too knowledgeable about the product, okay? And this is very, very important. Don't assume that when you're giving more fact-based stuff, it's gonna give it more credibility. Now, there's a place for giving those facts and I'll get into that in a second, but lead with the emotion first, okay? And I'd go into this a little bit in the do section as well, but lead with the emotion first.

So, whenever you're talking about the product, think about what the average consumer would say if this product actually changed their life. Reality is, most people aren't gonna look super deep into the ingredients and why they do what they do. However, the average person would try to support what they're saying with a little bit of knowledge, okay? So, you have to find that middle ground of giving enough knowledge so it has enough credibility, but not giving too much where they're like, okay, this person's trying to sell me something, right? So, a great example that I can show you guys is with our friend, Makayla.

I'll actually pull up a video of that. There's somebody playing music outside. Let me pause this real quick.

Okay, guys, so if you haven't seen Makayla's Yerba Magic Brainyista Run, you haven't seen this video, this is definitely a crazy example of how far a really organic talking head can take you, but I want you to pay attention to in this, what I'm gonna show you right now, how she introduces the product and how natural she introduces the ingredients. She's finding that perfect middle ground of not giving too much, but giving enough, right? So, something that she does, she leans really hard into the storyline, right? And this is something I talked about in the conversion module as well, but even after she introduces the product, she does this kind of foot off the gas. That's kind of what I like to call it.

You introduce the product and then you take your foot off the gas a little bit so it's not too salesy. You go back into your storyline and then you come back to it with a little bit of fact. So, she does it perfectly here.

Okay, so I just realized the audio's not recording, but you guys can see right here the words. So, she basically just introduces the product and then she takes her foot off the gas. She says, I was not prepared for this.

And then later on in the video, she says, it'll make you glow from within. It's got all the stuff for gut health. And then more than anything else, I stopped taking my focus medicine.

So, she goes back again to herself, right? It's got like L-theanine in it and I'm wondering if that's what it is. You see how smooth she's mentioning, she's dropping these ingredients for you without going hard. The reason that this is so effective is because that L-theanine actually helps to offset that midday crash.

That's very matter of fact. She's not doing that. She's telling you about her personal experience.

I think it's because it has L-theanine in it. You have to understand, people, they can kind of do a little bit of research on their own if they need to about what that ingredient is. Most of the time, they won't though.

If you're really selling them on that story of what it's done for you, that's all you need to do. So, this is a perfect example of a smooth like butter product intro. Okay, so understand the essence of what makes organic shop content successful.

It's because people want to buy from people. They don't wanna buy from a commercial on TV that's telling them how great this product is. That's not what you're meant to do.

You're meant to describe your personal experience or create a storyline around a product of why they need it and successfully sell them on that and then give them minimal facts to help them just push them a little bit further, right? So, I don't really like to introduce any facts about the product until like the end of the video with my CTA. I do like to, if I introduce some facts, I like to pull back, take my foot off the gas, then go back to my story and then come back to the product and say like apparently, Yerba Mate releases GLP-1 the same way the Zempik does. That's what I would say something like with the weight loss angle with Brainista.

And then if it's like the other half dog supplement, you could say it apparently has all of these ingredients in one place. You don't have to say apparently, I'm saying that word just because I'm saying it. But it has all of these ingredients for a fraction of the price that I was paying for it separately when I was trying to feed my dog this whole food diet.

It just wasn't realistic. I don't know exactly all the stuff that's in here, but my dog loves it and she wouldn't eat all the foods that I was buying and it's way cheaper. You know, something like that, just subtly dropping what's in the product makes it so much smoother and so much more believable, right? So, intro the product smoother, maybe even take a jab at something minimal to add that layer of trust, right? And this doesn't have to be directly about the product itself because it can go in the negative area, like if you're doing like a beef tallow, that's a brand I've run.

The only thing I don't really like about it is it doesn't really have a great smell to it, but it's bearable. So that might be a little bit too far. The one that I really like that a lot of people go back to is the only thing I don't like about this product is it's always going out of stock.

So as long as you see that orange car right there, it means that they're in stock, but you definitely should rush to get yourself some, right? But also do, I didn't state that we're on the do section now, also sell on emotions instead of logic. Lead with emotions, logic comes in just to push them that little bit forward. The essence of all successful copywriting is emotional.

Point blank. If you wanna move somebody to buy from you, you're gonna need to hit them in the emotions in some way. Walk them through that path of pain.

Yeah, so here's some good examples of some like smoother CTAs as well that I do prefer whenever you're, to just ease them into that sale a little bit more. Something like, we've been getting ours off of Amazon for months now, but for some reason when I just checked on TikTok, it's cheaper here than literally any other website. So I'm gonna leave you a link right here in the corner so you can get yourself some, and I would probably be quick because they're low on stock.

Okay, that's number one. Number two. We went through a lot of different brands out there and honestly, a lot of them were really counterintuitive.

They caused some negative effects. We came across some really cheap options that didn't really do much. And so we came across this brand right here, which has XYZ ingredients.

So make sure whatever one that you get, it has those ingredients or else you're not gonna have nearly the same level of effectiveness and it might actually hurt you. Now, I use some bigger words in that and I really think you should dumb down how you say it, but that was just to give you an example of the flow of that second one right there. One of my favorite CTAs, I use it a lot.

And then thirdly, which is really popular, you may have seen it. This usually works with the more popular products that have a lot of sales because there's a lot of scam listings up. It just adds more credibility, but you can do it with whatever product.

So the only problem with this product is because it's so popular, there's a lot of companies that are coming in and trying to take advantage, putting up scam listings. I don't want you guys to get scammed. So I'm gonna leave you a link to the actual product right here in this video.

As long as you see the orange card, it means that it's still in stock. If you don't see that orange card, don't go searching it up anywhere else because you are gonna get scammed and I can't guarantee you're gonna get the same ingredients. And with that scam one, it does add that extra level of like, oh, I need to buy it from their video like now because I might not see it again and somebody else might put up the scam link.

So that one is effective too. You can interchange these and you can get creative, y'all. These are just examples of some good CTAs as well that feel really organic.

So product intro and CTA goes hand in hand. Really try and make it feel really organic because you don't want to send off, you don't want to trigger that ad alarm because if you do, they're not gonna buy from you. All right, guys, thank you so much.
