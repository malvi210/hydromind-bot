How's it going you guys? A lot of these concepts that I described may have already been talked about already, but I'm giving them a name. I'm patenting them so that nobody else can use them. I'm just kidding. 

I am going to give them a name because I feel like it makes it more tangible for you guys. It makes it easier to implement for yourself. So this is something that I like to call the Frankenstein method or the better efficiency method. 

So if you guys haven't seen my productivity module, make sure to watch that. It kind of works in tandem with this. But this is another way I make sure that I can stay productive and I have endless ideas.

Another example is like the Malte method of the 80-20 that I coined as well. But this is a little bit different. So this is another way that you can approach your videos to just add. 

These all kind of compound with each other. So 80-20 with emotion, that's more of like the meta. This is more of the technical side. 

So I wanted to give you guys that as well so it's more tangible. So I want to show you guys that like an actual example of how I did this the other day. So let's go ahead and look at this video that's gone viral recently for Serene.

It's been very successful. And let me make sure my audio is here. If I find you, I'm going to give you the biggest hug ever.

Okay, so let me restart. To this motherfucker right here, if I find you, I'm going to give you the biggest hug ever. Because listen to what he just said.

If you have a pooch that you can't get rid of, listen up. This is for you. You don't need to be taking more diets. 

You don't need to be doing more ab workouts, right? Getting that surgery. Try this stuff first. Is that a fucking rumor outside? When I saw this, I'm not going to lie. 

I thought it was total BS because you either have to work out or be on that because they were all five stars. After reading it. Okay, so this is that angle. 

That's how it works. He showed a green screen. So this is what I do.

I'll take a script of a popular video that's been working. If it's within a similar niche, most definitely I like to make it work, but you can make it work with any product. And that's why this is literally endless. 

And I'll show you there's very little things you have to change. And that's why it's called the Frankenstein method. So take that script right there, go to talk script, enter that URL into here.

You're going to go ahead and take this script right here. I'm going to go ahead and copy that script, go to your document right here, paste that in there. Now you have the whole script in here. 

Yeah. So what you're going to do then is you're going to change the hook. That's what I always change.

I always make sure to change the hook so you can see right here. I don't want to leak anything, but this is what I said. I would slurp this girl. 

I would slip this girl's toes up so quickly if I saw her in public, because listen to what she just said. So it adds that more emotion to it. What are you talking about slurping up toes? What kind of video is this about to be? So you can see I changed the hookup and then I also implemented a video that's going to be with my product that I have. 

And it was a video that hasn't been used yet for this. And I think that's important because I think a lot of people use washed ass clips trying to have the same effect. But the thing is you can use that same kind of structure of that video and just add something new to it. 

Right. You're adding a different video to it. So that's what I did. 

It hasn't been cooked yet. Not a lot of people have seen the video. I went ahead and I took that video.

So if we see right here, this is the video that I actually took. I bought the shit that all the hot girls called nature's epic and I was not expecting this shit to erase. Okay. 

So we don't need to watch the whole video, but I basically did laptop on it as well. And then what I did after that is I looked in. Yeah. 

So I looked in the script right here after that. And I went ahead and I, and I saw after the clip was introduced, I saw how he kind of broke it down, how he did the product intro, how he did the CTA. And I noticed it was pretty weak compared to what he did. 

So this is what's great too. If you have a winning CTA as a creator, your journey as a move along. Because what I did was I took his whole breakdown. 

I took his whole everything. So the only thing that I kept here, you can notice right here, he says, I'm not going to lie. I thought it was total BS because you have to either work out or be on that same shot. 

But then I look at the reviews. They were all five stars and people thanking them. The only part that I kept was this. 

Okay. From this video. And this is what it becomes the Frankenstein method. 

Okay. Cause this is what I did after he does this little breakdown that I did keep for my own. What I did was it actually goes straight here. 

What I did was I went to another popular video of mine. That's been converting really, really well. And you can do this with any video actually, but it's going to be great if it's your own video too. 

I went to my own video. I took it back into talk script, pasted that in there. And then I got my video and make sure you hide timestamps here. 

I got my winning CTA, which I think is fleshed out a little bit more as well, especially for this product. What I did is I went to go to my story and my CTA, my product intro, all that. I basically copied and pasted that right into here and boom, your script is complete. 

That's it. So what did I change here? I changed the clip that's used. I changed the hook and I changed maybe a little bit of the bridge. 

That's it. You see how easy and how productive that is. That is why this is so powerful because you can literally do this with any sort of structure that's out there. 

If you do this with any video, you can patch things together that work and just, you can maybe go in and amend things a little bit just to give it more continuity because that's very important. So I have this storyline that I've already developed and that's why it does look a little bit different from this ending breakdown and CTA right here because I had to kind of make it work for this one. But I used virtually the exact same structure. 

All I did was give it that continuity. So obviously I have to make things work with this little bridge that he put in the video. So to break it down, I said this little change part, but then I went back to the neck department, anywhere else. 

Listen, do not resort to that shot that everybody's taking that costs upwards of $1,500 a month. Easy. Plug. 

CTA. Done. The kill is ours. 

Bring it home, feed it to your family. That's what it is.
