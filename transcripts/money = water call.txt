All right, guys, I appreciate you showing up for this little call. I'm not gonna keep you guys for too long. Like I said, I don't know everything, but I do wanna offer you my unique perspective when it comes to not just TikTok shop, but money in general, life in general.

This is a Branista call that, so I'm primarily speaking to the Branista server whenever we do this. I am not the Branista manager. Everybody always reaches out to me thinking I'm the manager.

That would be Tyler Drinkard. Just so you guys know, not me. I know he stays very low key, but we did wanna open this call up to the entirety of CC and also even our people in the Branista server also.

So I wanted to, yeah, this is something I've been wanting to touch on for a really long time, and I figured it would be very beneficial, especially for the Branista server. So that is the pretense of the conversation. But like I said, it'll be very general.

The last mindset call is pretty good. So I think this one will do well also. So let's jump into it.

Money equals water. So this is kinda how I conceptualize everything in terms of money, but also in terms of everything. I kinda use money as a visual, I mean, water as a visual for everything.

So it's gonna make more sense as we go along. I have a lot of different analogies that I use for this, and hopefully it resonates. All right, so let's jump straight into it.

So we are in the ocean, okay? This is how we're gonna open up this conversation right here. Is it actually choppy for everybody? I don't know why it would be choppy. Let me know if we're still bad.

Oh no. Okay, let me know if it gets fixed up. I'll just keep the chat open over here so I can see, and y'all just let me know if stuff messes up.

Hopefully it records fine on my end too. Yeah, my internet's not the best right now, but hopefully it stays good. Okay, so I'm gonna explain what this means a little bit in a second, but you can kinda start to visualize this already.

In this opportunity that we're in, it is a very good opportunity ocean. It is a huge opportunity. I'm sure that a lot of you understand that so far.

You've seen every single day, you've seen all of these people making absurd amounts of money, whether you're in the Brinista server, or you're in the entire Creators Corner server. You can see that it is a massive opportunity. And I kind of think of this like, so if you guys haven't seen, if you haven't read the Russell Brunson series of books, he talks about the red ocean, the blue ocean.

I'm gonna show you guys that visual after this slide, but just understand that we are in a very good opportunity space. So I think having gratitude for that is very, very important, first of all. There is less than 2,000 people in Creators Corner, and I did the math for you guys on what that actually is.

So it's 0.0000025% of the entire world population. If you can't be grateful for that, I don't know what to tell you. Maybe you're just not able to be grateful for anything.

That is actually insane. Not only are we in the craziest opportunity today for making money, but we are in the best community for it ever. Like it's indisputable.

Whatever opinion you have about Creators Corner, whatever opinion you have about even the Brenista server, if I'm addressing people who aren't in Creators Corner that are in the Brenista server, these brands that we work with are number one and repeatedly show up number one. Creators Corner as a community shows up number one all the time. So very, very hard to be ungrateful whenever you really put that into perspective.

So I want you guys to visualize the opportunity ocean that we're in firstly, foremost. So give you guys that visual right here so you can see what I'm talking about. So a red ocean is basically, you can kind of think of it like there's sharks in the ocean, right? There's a lot of sharks there already that have kind of came into that opportunity and they've taken up a lot.

It's become oversaturated in more familiar terms, right? There's a lot of competition. And it's not to say we don't have competition. I mean, we don't have competition really, but it's not to say that there's not people in the TikTok shop space, but TikTok shop is a very, very new vehicle for creating wealth.

And there is so much opportunity. Hopefully, hopefully in the recording, it doesn't chop out you guys. I'm sorry if it's chopping out.

Okay, hopefully, yeah. Hopefully in the recording, it doesn't chop out. I don't know.

I'm trying to, I'm gonna keep it still going. If you guys, if it's really unwatchable, you can just go ahead and leave. I'm just gonna go through it.

I apologize for that. Okay, but since we are in the ocean, now that we've laid that out, I want you guys to find your stream. So if you look at, yeah, well, I mean, I don't want you guys to sit here and watch it, Mia, if it's not like loading.

I'm sorry. I'm just hoping, I'm really hoping that on my end, it comes across clear and all the recording works. But now that we're in the, you understand that we're in the ocean, I want you guys to find your individual stream because we have this amazing opportunity, but everybody has a very unique way of going about this opportunity, right? So you guys probably have seen my bio or, that's been my bio, I think, since like December on Discord because it's like really how I think about money and everything in general.

Like you find the stream that's there, it's already flowing, right? And then you just stand in front of it. And it's that simple. You don't have to overcomplicate it.

And whenever you can visualize it like that, the ocean's already there, you stand in front of the stream. It's like, I don't know, for me, just that visual just makes it so much easier to facilitate success and money in general. It's just like, I don't know, like whenever I'm drinking water, whenever I'm drinking water, I think about money.

I don't know how crazy that sounds, but that's really how I conceptualize it. So that's one thing. But allowing money to flow in unison with your creative energy too.

Because everything is energy, right? Money is energy. And whenever you think of it like that, money is always, energy is always being transformed into another form of energy. It's never being created.

It's never being destroyed. And so whenever you think about it like that and you allow it to become this kind of ecosystem in your mind, it's very, very hard to not think abundantly anymore. And I always, I'll talk too about that whenever I get to the stagnation thing, but that's a slide.

I don't wanna get too ahead of myself. So I think whenever you can visualize money like that, it becomes like effortless to receive it. It's a really weird thing.

At least that's my experience. It's like, you can't stop making money even if you tried, if you realize that it's as abundant and as easy to obtain as water. You know? So yeah, every day's money is flowing, whether you're having it in your pocket or not, right? Whether you have it with you or not, money is always gonna be flowing between people's hands.

So all you have to do to be able to facilitate your success, your wealth is redirect that. Stand in front of the stream. It's literally not real.

Focus on what money represents. It represents creative energy. The basis of everything is creative energy.

I think that's why the position that we're in as creators, you know, content creators, it's so, everything's just so aligned. You're doing the exact thing that people have been doing forever, creating a psychological benefit or creating a way to, you know, infest into people's minds and move them to a certain position. That's all it is.

And so it's really amazing that we're in this opportunity. And I just really wanna stress that to you guys. So you can think of Bruce Lee as well, and this will kind of segue into my next slide, which I love the next slide.

I'm gonna actually make a separate call on this one as well, but I don't need to read this quote for you. I'm sure a lot of you guys have heard this or an iteration of it, but if you put water into a cup, it becomes the cup. If you put water into a bottle, it becomes the bottle.

Water can flow or it can crash. So whenever you're crashing out per se, let's translate this into brain rot terms. Whenever you're crashing out, does that mean that you're no longer in the position to receive money? No, it just means that you're using the energy in an incorrect way.

You never go away from this. Like you never divert from the path that you've been given for ultimate success. It just, the responsibility lies on you.

You always have that opportunity to redirect that stream and properly go about what you wanna do. So a really cool thing as well. Shout out to Bruce Lee.

And then that goes into this. So, oh, I love this one. And I'm gonna make a whole separate slideshow probably about this and do this one as well.

I really, really hope this recording is working, but either way, all arts are the same. And I often reference the other art forms in order to make things more tangible in, it says my connection's unstable. I'm gonna wait a bit.

I often reference the other art forms in order to make what we do here more tangible because it's an art form as well. Dono, I don't know if it's Dono or Dono, but tell me you're into Tekken. Yes, I'm 100% into Tekken.

I love Tekken. I actually have a little figurine of Devil Jin sitting on my entertainment center. Either way, mind, body, and spirit are the essential building blocks for every single art form.

Every single art form. So how I relate this to sales, right? I use a boxing analogy. I like this one a lot.

So it's like, I lagged for 10 seconds at a time. It's terrible. I use a boxing analogy for sales, right? It's like you can't, you have to be aggressive whenever you've opened up your opponent emotionally.

So it's like, whenever you go to your sale bit, whenever you're trying to convert the person to buy the product, right? You want to open them up emotionally first and then strike them with logic a little bit, you know? And then you go back, you're back in defense, you're emotionally opening them up because it's like, if you're pushing too hard and you're always on the offense, you're gonna get knocked out. And that's what it is. So I think martial arts is a beautiful analogy for this too because it's like, every martial art form, if you guys have played Tekken, you'll know what I'm talking about, but Tekken is honestly a perfect example of this because it's like pure MMA, mixed martial arts, because what this game has done is it's made it so all of these amazing fighting styles are highlighted, but what you come to recognize is that each one has its own weaknesses and its own unfair advantages, but they're all on equal playing fields.

So you as a creator also can imagine yourself as having a fighting style that you use whenever you make content, whenever you're doing sales. You have your own unique advantages that you need to utilize and you also have your own unique weaknesses, but we all have equal opportunity. So all fighting styles, they leverage their own respective cultural advantages or whatever that may be.

You know, fighting is a sacred dance and this is kind of where we bridge that gap between martial arts and other forms of art that aren't necessarily video creation, right? It's a dance. It really is a dance and then you can also kind of move into like the war with oneself, which is a huge thing in Eastern martial arts for sure. So that's another really cool analogy that I like to use and why I included this in the water slideshow is because it's all fluid.

You know, it's like all the art forms are fluid as well and so it's like, it kind of makes sense in my head. I don't know if it makes sense for you guys, but I think it's really, really cool as well. Yeah, it's been cutting out the whole time, judge.

Sorry, bro. I don't know what's going on with my Wi-Fi. I'm just hoping that this all gets recorded correctly.

Okay, very, very important slide here and I mentioned it earlier in the slideshow as well. Don't, if we visualize money as water, what happens when you let water stagnate? It grows bacteria. It becomes deadly in some cases.

Same thing happens when you allow your money to stagnate, when you allow the energy to stagnate. You always have to keep money in motion. You always have to, you always have to keep it in motion.

So I, it really makes me upset whenever I see, it's really gross, like honestly, whenever I see billionaires that just let their money sit there instead of putting it in motion. Like at least buy an expensive car or do whatever you need to do because it's like, people think about that as like a gross display of wealth, you know, like buy a Bugatti or whatever it is. But honestly, I think it's much grosser and much more materialistic to let it sit and not do anything because what's gonna happen if you actually go to spend that on that Bugatti? You know what I mean? The owner of Bugatti, whoever's working for that company, they're gonna receive that and they're gonna put it back into the ecosystem.

So I think it's important. It's not even about, yeah, put it all on black. Exactly, Chris.

No, but for real though, I think it's really, really important to not let the money stagnate because what can happen, it really goes in alignment with abundance mindset too. You know, and it doesn't mean, I'm not just talking about money here. It's also like, if you're not allowing the energy to flow either, it's just not gonna be, nothing's gonna flow.

Nothing's gonna work in your life. You can't let anything flow. Currency, yeah.

Connection says it's unstable. Currency, currency, keep it moving. Yeah, people are putting in the chat.

You guys won't be able to see in the recording, but a current is water. Yeah, exactly, 100%, total alignment. So summary here, money is energy and energy must stay in motion.

So you have to submit to money to allow it into your life. It's a really, it's almost seems like an oxymoron there, but you have to submit to money to be able to allow it into your life. You have to submit to the natural flow of what it is.

You know, it's not meant to stay stagnant ever. Neither is water and you can't let it because it'll grow bacteria. Yeah, so I mentioned this analogy earlier on in the call, but nothing can stop the flow of it.

Nothing can stop the flow of it. Simply allow it into your life. Do whatever kind of visuals you need to do.

Realize, kind of get yourself into that mindset that you couldn't go broke if you tried. You know, it really is that. It really is that.

Like, don't worry about like stock issues or if a video slows down because once again, the water is always there flowing and anytime a new idea hits for you, the money will be there. It will always be there. It's always flowing and somebody's always ready to put it into your bank account.

Not actually, but you know, like when it goes through TikTok and blah, blah, blah. Yeah, very, very important. Never let anything stop your flow there.

And this is what's really cool about this too is whenever you're able to visualize money like this, whenever you're able to facilitate that flow a lot better, maybe I'll turn off my camera and see if that's better. Whenever you're able to allow money to flow like that, it no longer becomes something that you desire. Whenever you don't have money, it becomes your God.

And what do I mean by that? It means you worship money. You always are thinking about money and it's all you can think about because if you don't have it, then you're always thinking about like, oh, how am I gonna be able to afford this? And if you, and you're always, maybe you're fantasizing. You're thinking about like, oh, if I had money, I would do this.

If I had money, I would do that. Maybe I'd be happier. That all stems from desire.

It all stems from a place of lack. And whenever you shift into that abundance mindset, you're able to truly, in my opinion, attain freedom and focus on what actually matters. And so I think that whenever you're able to transcend the desire of having money and realize that it's always flowing, that's how you can gain true freedom and appreciate other things besides that.

So yeah, I hope that I wasn't cutting out towards the end too. That might've honestly fixed it. I should have been doing that the entire call, but this honestly wasn't that long of one.

I just wanted to be able to get all these concepts kind of together and display them in a way that kind of makes sense and make it concise. Did I stop cutting out towards the end right there? I don't know if I just fumbled everything and I could have been doing that the whole time, but yeah, it wasn't super long presentation, but I think that concept might resonate with a lot of you guys, and I'm hoping that it did. And yeah, I just kind of want to collect these thoughts into a slideshow.

I probably will be doing another one on the intersection of the arts thing, because I think that was a really cool one. And I don't know, guys. I don't know why I do that.

I don't know why I do that with everything. I always make everything a visual, but for me, it makes sense. Yeah, dude, I don't know.

I don't know what's going on with the Wi-Fi here. I didn't think anything would mess up, but I hope y'all kind of got some good stuff out of it, either way. Appreciate you, Alex.

Yeah, no, the thing is, judge, it wouldn't really do anything out here, because I'm in the city. I think Starlink works best out in the country. Okay, guys, but I appreciate you for showing up.

I'm sorry that I was a failure, and a lot of you probably left, but hopefully the recording comes across well. And yeah, for sure. So if you guys have anything else that you wanted to ask about or talk about, I'll leave it open for a little bit.

Yeah, there will be a replay. I did record it, so hopefully it's all recorded well. I'll post it for you guys in the Brunista server, as well as in Creators Corner.

So I appreciate you guys showing up. And yeah, maybe next time I'll get my Wi-Fi together a little bit better. Thank you, guys.

Appreciate your time. I'll talk to you guys later.
