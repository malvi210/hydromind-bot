What is going on, my lovely people? This is yet another one of these modules, the most sauce that you will ever receive from somebody who is using the Comic Sans infamous font. Alright, so, to take y'all into my mind for just a second, right now I'm looking at our campaigns that we got running, or my campaigns that I'm working on right now, and the biggest thing where we want to put our priority on the back end is making y'all go viral. Okay? And, here's the thing.

A lot of you guys are amazing creators, and you have these amazing scripts. You know, they're very educational, they give a lot of information, and they don't say too much. Sometimes, like, if you see my Dumb Speak module, you know that I've talked about, like, making sure that you're saying that education in a way that's digestible, it's not giving them too much education.

Y'all are doing that. A lot of y'all are doing that. It's coming through effectively, clean, it's hard-hitting, but the one thing that you're missing is the virality.

And how do you go viral? By stopping the scroll. Okay? And how do you stop the scroll? Is with a great hook. So, it's very, very important.

If you guys haven't seen Bean's call in CC, where he talks about hooks, it's like a hook masterclass, definitely recommend watching that. Honestly, a lot of the wisdom that I've gotten around hooks has come from Bean's, because I've done a private session with him in the past, paid him for a consulting call. So, a lot of the stuff I talk about here will be that, but then also, some of it will be some recent stuff that I really have come to realize more.

So, I'm actually going to add some stuff to my notes here, because I want to talk about these last things too, which I'm at right now. It's a constant journey as a creator, because I'm still in the trenches creating with y'all. But there's some other things that came up.

So, a lot of y'all have amazing videos that can convert, but it's like, you need to get enough people to see it. I know that a lot of y'all's videos, if they were to go viral, you would be getting so many sales on them. But that's honestly why it hasn't gone viral, because you're focusing too much on the conversion and too much on the product, and you're not focusing on making that appeal to a wide audience.

So, what does that mean? Let's talk about it in practice. Let me lower this font size significantly, and let me talk about a few things. So, firstly, product, focus, hook, or niche hook, is what you'll hear me call it a lot, and then your general hook.

This is something that I talk about with people a lot. So, a lot of you have that first hook down, but you don't have that second hook down. And it's important that you have both.

So, think of it like you have two hooks, as of right now. You have two hooks in every single video. For one, your general hook comes first, so I actually should place this one above the other one right here.

Your general hook is most important, so that's gonna be what you focus on first. This is gonna be appealing to the mass hive mind. So, every single person that sees this video should have a reason to keep watching.

Even if they don't care at all about hair or dog stuff, which is the two brands that I'm gonna use for example, because those are the two campaigns I'm running as of recording this video. Even if they don't care at all about those things, they should have a reason to want to watch the video. So, you have to successfully do it to where the general hook is not too left field, to where it's not going to convert at all.

But you have to make sure at the same time that you have a not too niche of a hook to where it's not gonna appeal to a wide audience. So, it's this balancing act. Everything in this content game is a balancing act and it acts the very same way.

So, let's talk about this in practice. For let's say other half, my dog supplement brand that I'm working with right now. So, instead of... If your dogs are struggling, let's say if your dogs have bad breath and it just stinks so bad, instead of just saying that, instead of just talking about it, what can you do to make that appeal to a wider audience, a general audience? What you can do, you can show some really nasty teeth of a dog.

You can show a really crazy scenario of this dog who maybe they had their teeth rot to a point where they had to get dentures or something. I don't know if dogs get dentures, but find a picture of a dog with dentures. That's crazy.

What? And then let's talk about... And so, what happens is you have a dog-centered video, but then also at the same time, me who doesn't own a dog, you need to kind of think about it from the position of somebody who doesn't have the desire or doesn't have the pain that you're trying to target. So, with the hair gummies that I'm also working on, that campaign right now, instead of just saying, if you want to have amazing, luscious hair, like think the very L'Oreal commercial of like, you want to have thick, strong hair? This is the best product. Like, less of that, more of pictures of your hair falling out or pulling your hair out and it's coming out in clumps and it's like, oh, that's terrible or oh, that makes me afraid because maybe that could happen to me.

So, finding out a way to really capture pain that doesn't even exist for people, that sucks. Finding out how to capture pain that's maybe not already existent, you have to use language that's like that. My oven smells like it's burning.

That's gross. Okay, so it's just because I just moved in here, but moving on. It's like the dust burning up, whatever.

Alongside these two hooks, I also want you to be thinking about three other hooks. It's going to sound crazy, but just hear me out. Visual hook, audio hook, and text hook.

Now, I know text is also kind of visual, but it makes sense. It's like that. You can think about it like that, okay? So, you basically have five hooks, even though some of them may overlap.

So, along with that, this is more psychological stuff, more tangible stuff is be doing something in the video that is a hook. So, for example, with Year of the Magic, it's like a weight loss angle. I had a balloon to look like my stomach and I popped the balloon.

That's a visual hook. You need an audio hook. So, another thing I did with that video, I said if you have this problem and you're trying to get rid of it, I'm going to show you how to do that.

And I popped the balloon. And why is that an audio hook? Because it sounds like I'm talking about something that's not weight loss. Okay.

And then your text hook. You can make it something that's... So, what's beautiful about this is whenever you realize that you have so many hooks, you can make sure that one of these three is two of these. You can have that general hook.

So, you can have a video where your spoken word is very general, but your text is very niche and vice versa. So, yeah, guys. When you realize you have this many hooks and you're really focusing on all of them, it's impossible to not go viral.

I promise you. Another couple of things that I do want to touch on. So, an analogy that Beans gave me in our call is you want to kind of conceptualize... A lot of us watch YouTube.

And you want to think about those first few seconds of your TikTok video as like a YouTube thumbnail. So, whatever visuals you're showing, that's the thumbnail. So, go on YouTube.

You know, look at the videos that make you want to click on them. Why does that thumbnail make you want to click on it? Okay. And then if it's the title that makes you want to click on it, that's the same idea that you apply to the text that you're using.

So, your text is your YouTube title. Essentially, that's how you can think about it. And then your visual hook would be something like the YouTube thumbnail.

So, that analogy really helped me. I don't know if it'll help y'all. Another thing, another couple things, a little bit of extra that I've really been trying to hone in on for my own stuff is symmetry and more colors.

So, symmetry, very important. Aesthetics are very important if a video is going to do well. It doesn't mean it has to be completely symmetrical, but it has to look congruent.

So, I think Sydney does this really well with a lot of her videos. Beans does it amazing, perfectly centered. And it does not mean perfectly centered.

That's not what I'm saying, what I mean by symmetry. Like, most of the time, yes. If it's like text and stuff and you have the space for it, I would recommend it.

But it's completely okay, too. Okay, so let's say your head, let's say I'm the video right now. My head is taking up this much space.

I want to have text right here, image right here. Kind of like symmetrical or congruent. What is the word? Parallel.

Parallel with my chin and the top of my head. That's what I mean by symmetry, really. And then, colors.

It's a pattern interrupt. So, if you're going to add any sort of extra visual stimuli in your videos, very important. But, this was all to say, we're at a point in these campaigns where we need to go viral.

Guys, if you go viral and it's a product that somebody even virtually needs and you hold it in front of their face, they're going to buy it. They will buy it if they need it. Like, selling, you need to get out of the idea of like, complete conversions all the time because a lot of you are great.

Like, you don't even have to be great, super great salespeople. What we do here, the hardest part of it is going viral. So, that's what I want us to fully focus on now.

And I hope that with this module right here, you guys could start to think about, you know, these things that you could actively do to force your stuff to go viral. Because you can't just pray and hope that it goes to the perfect first 300 people that care about hair loss or care about their dog that much. You can't just pray that it hits the next 1,000 people to send it to the next whatever amount of people.

You have to do everything in your power to force that video to go viral and hooks is 90% of that. So, that is this module. Thank you so much.
