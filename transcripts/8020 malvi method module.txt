How is it going, ladies and gentlemen? So we recently did a call in one of the servers about this very thing right here, but I wanted to make this short little loom so I can consolidate those ideas that we did talk about in the call, so I can share this also server-wide with my people. I know that as a newer creator, you know, we hear these terms that get thrown around, we don't really understand what they mean. I know that when I first came in the game, there's lingo that you gotta understand as you go along, and you will pick it up naturally, right? But I think there's a problem with the way that we hear terms, and then we kind of get this understanding for them, and then the meaning is kind of lost, right? And you don't have to keep necessarily a very static meaning to these terms either.

So to get into it, the term that I'm gonna be speaking about today is called 80-20. So if you're a newer creator and you don't know what that means, basically, in the most basic terms, you take 80% of a viral video that's worked or has converted, take 80% of that video, and keep it generally the same, and then you add a 20% uniqueness to it, a flair, right? But I like to take it a little bit further because this is a little bit of a breakthrough that I had recently, and I kind of already understood this concept, but a few weeks ago, this really, really clicked. I realized that there is endless creativity for you.

So if you're struggling with creativity, obviously, this is gonna be applicable to you if you're just wanting ability to make better videos in general, but especially if you're struggling with creativity, which is obviously the most important thing as a creator that's literally in the word, this is going to be so helpful for you, in my opinion. So this is what I call the Malvi method for 80-20ing. And so I say you're not 80-20ing the content.

I want you to get that out of your head. What you're doing in this game is you're 80-20ing the psychology of why these videos work, okay? And when you start to think in terms of emotions instead of technicalities, instead of logic, that's where you start to see money really come in, and that's where you start to see yourself capturing attention that does convert into money. And so a lot of this stuff will tie back into emotion, but I want you guys to start thinking in those terms, right? So whenever you're 80-20ing, and I'll get more into it as we get further into this little thing right here, but when you look at a video, forget your eyes, forget your ears, forget any of that, feel the video.

I want you to take those same emotions and structure your script around those emotions. What is the emotional journey that the video is taking you through that makes you want to purchase that product? Full stop. What is the emotional journey that video is taking through that makes you want to keep watching the video? Full stop.

Those are the most important things, right? And what's amazing about this is when you start to see with emotion, instead of seeing the technicalities and all this other stuff, I think a lot of us in this space are pretty smart, and a lot of us may come from a very analytical background, and that's great, but it doesn't convert well into sales, into driving a story home. And so you need to start seeing with those creative eyes in terms of emotions, in terms of leading people down that same path of pain, all this sort of stuff. You see what I'm saying? So let's go ahead and get into it.

And what's great about this is you can use this method, you can find any style of video, and you can make it work for yourself. So instead of a traditional 80-20, where you're literally seeing the exact style, and you're copying that exact style, you're able to do something way different. So let me just make sure that my, okay, so my sound is actually disabled at the moment.

It should have fixed the sound now, so you guys should be able to see it. All right, so if I play this video, you should be able to hear it. Let's see.

No, you do not. Hold on. All right, I think we're good now.

I don't think we are, but we'll just watch through. Okay, so what I want you to see right here is that this is a really, really, it's not even a green screen. It's more so, I don't even know what you would call this style, but it's showing, and this is NeuroGum, okay? This is where I got the idea the other day.

You'll see this is a clip of Zeus and Bilou. They're talking about NeuroGum in this clip. So it's very organic, because they're talking to each other.

They're reaction YouTubers. And so this is a really good video to study. So he said, I was like, he says, you know how they say that you only use one half of your brain? This makes you use your entire brain, right? I knew it was like the Limitless Playhole, because when I first took it, I was like, I can get some shit done.

And he's like, you guys can't hear it, but he said like, and it was that type of vibe. And he was like laughing with Zeus right here. I think this is Zeus, I think this is Bilou.

I might be wrong, but either way, it's like this very organic laughing tonality. So I was like, this script will convert perfectly into a talking head. So what I did is I literally, line by line, I took that script from these videos, which are all clips, there's no talking head, and I converted it into a talking head, right? So I essentially said some of the same stuff.

So you all know how they say we only use like one half of our brain? I found something that makes you use your entire brain. And I knew this was basically the pill from Limitless when I first tried it, because as soon as it first hit, I was like, okay, I can actually get some shit done. And I even put here, copy the laughing tonality right here.

And then they even double down, they say, this is not promo. They need to pay us a bag though, right? So this I did even more creative, I took it, I didn't really copy those words. And I'm not affiliated with these people or anything, I'm just your fellow ADD kid, suffering from stimulus, it messed up my heart, couldn't use caffeine, all this, but this thing changed everything for me, it solved all of my problems.

So I completely changed up the wording there. But what is this making you feel here, right? This is what you wanna analyze. Why is this video effective? This video did convert well too.

Why is this effective? Because it feels really organic, it feels like you're talking to a friend. It feels really, so you wanna be able to capture that emotion and be able to filter it into whatever style that you're using. So what's amazing about this, is you can go watch a green screen video, you can make that a talking head.

You can go watch a talking head video, you can make that a green screen. You need to stop thinking in terms of, you see these green screen clips and you see how effective they are, and you're like, oh, it's because of the clip, it's because there's authority figure, it's because of this, it's because of that. No, it's because of that direct clip caused a certain emotion to be evoked in our consumer.

Bare bones, strip it down to the bare bones. That's exactly what it's doing. So if you can emulate those same emotions for the viewer, that's all you need to do.

That's literally all it is. You see that all these styles are working, so why not take what's working and make it pretty much completely your own. This is something that I don't think a lot of people talk about when they're 80, 20.

They look at it very literally. I'll tell people about some stuff that I've noticed. See, they even talked about Joe Rogan doing this, right? So I said in my script, I've even seen Joe Rogan endorse this shit before, and I've never seen him endorse anything.

And then I could even go into showing the clip if I want, but in my talking head I did, I ended up not doing it. So yeah, y'all. And what's great about this is you can consolidate.

So whenever you're 80, 20-ing as well, you wanna be able to, a really successful 80, 20, it takes out the unnecessary filler words that don't add to the plot at all, don't add to the storyline, and then it just adds in words as needed for emotion. That's the only two things that you wanna be doing when you're 80, 20-ing a script. But if you're gonna be traditionally 80, 20-ing, so if you're gonna be using the same lines is what I mean.

But when you're doing new lines, you're able to really get creative there, and I think that's what makes this, maybe not even 80, 20, maybe a little bit more than an 80, 20, but you are still sticking to that same emotional framework, and so that's why I still would go to call it an 80, 20. So yeah, guys, you can see right here, then I, after the clip right here, let me see, let me skip ahead, because this is just Joe Rogan clip. So then this creator goes in to say he's talking about NeuroGum, also called the Limitless Pill.

So he's basically value dumping here. So I kind of do the same thing. Yeah, it's called NeuroGum, it has caffeine, B vitamins, and L-theanine.

He goes more of like a bottom of funnel kind of vibe, you know, like more educational based. Since I was doing a strict talking head, I went more of the organic way of my personal storyline. I try to consolidate this stuff, keep it as emotional as possible, add that urgency, all that sort of stuff.

But yeah, that's essentially what this 80, 20 psychology thing looks like. It's all about seeing with emotions, not with eyes, not with ears, none of that. The most important thing for this to work is seeing with emotions.

And when you do this, you can go on any single shop video that's doing well for any sort of brand whatsoever. And you can say, oh, this angle is attacking them with fear. You know, how can I take the same kind of wording that they use, plug in my own product, I can make them feel that fear as well.

If something takes you down a really emotional journey, you're not reinventing the wheel. I'm sorry to tell you, every successful storyline, which is what these videos are in human history follows a pretty much the same storyline. I mean, pretty much the same format.

And that's a very important thing as a creator, especially newer creator, you need to be following frameworks that already work. Every artist does it, copy like an artist. What that means is you're not directly copying it, you are 80, 20.

And then in this sense, you're creating emotions. And that's what every artist does. Content creation is an art.

So you need to be able to create that emotion in people. When you look at a great painting, what does it do? It makes you feel a certain way. And sometimes it's a very specific kind of way that you can't even describe how it makes you feel.

That's the same kind of application you wanna be using in this work here. It's an art, it's an art. So learn how to copy like an artist, you will be insanely wealthy.

And that's what I had to say for this. So thank you guys so much. Please hit me up in your coaching chat or wherever if you need any clarification.

Love you guys. Let's continue to crush.
