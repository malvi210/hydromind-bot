All right, so we're recording now. Appreciate all you guys showing up. This is going to be a cool call. 

I put this together the other day. I really, I'm confident this call will touch some of you and I'm hoping it'll be a lot of you. You know, if you guys don't know what I've done, I'll kind of get into that a little bit more throughout the presentation, but for the past few years before I joined CC and before I, you know, started this management stuff, I've been really deep into religious studies. 

I mean, spirituality has always been a big part of my life and I think the overall, you know, meta of the community that we built in all of the, you know, CC as well as all the individual brand servers, it's really built on a strong sense of spirituality, right? Like a lot of us have a really strong, you know, faith, whatever that may be. And I think it's just really important and it aligns with me. So I figured why not kind of utilize what I've learned in the space that I've been working in for the past few years and bring it to y'all as creators, because I think it's really, really cool whenever you can, in your work, you know, honor God. 

So, and we'll get a deeper into it in a second. I appreciate y'all for joining. Got Matt Palmer in the building too.

I will say that Matt really made things click for me on some of this stuff that I'm going to expand on today. I mean, he might've left already, but either way, I'm going to share my screen y'all and let me know if we can see this slideshow. I'm going to make it full screen and I'm going to make, okay, so hold on. 

Let me know if that looks full screen for y'all. I'm going to open this chat right here. Perfect. 

Let's get it. All right. Yeah. 

So I'm going to try, I'm going to try not to take too much of you guys' time, but I also do want to be kind of thorough while I'm going through this stuff because it really is really, really important. Like I was talking with Matt the other day and 90% of what you do here as a creator is mindset. 90%. 

I'm confident on 90%. And it may seem like an overshoot for some of y'all, but I promise you that is 90% of the equation, a hundred percent. So this is a huge thing that's going to cover that. 

Specifically, the most important thing to me is detachment. And it's important in both ways, both, you know, whenever you find success and whenever you haven't had that success yet. So I'm going to go through here, talk about some stuff that we're doing in the Roosevelt Hair Gummy server that just launched too. 

And I'm going to try to give you guys as much value as I can in like 30 to 40 minutes or whatever. And we'll just chop it up. So this is perform your duty. 

This is a mindset masterclass. So let's get it. All right. 

So I want to tell y'all a little bit about me. So you have like, we can set the stage too. I already told y'all, I started doing the religious stuff a while back since 2022. 

And this is important. You'll understand why, but I started content creation when I was super young before it was a thing. Like I'm talking like I used to have the camcorders with the VHS and I was recording myself. 

I was doing vlogs before YouTube was a thing because YouTube came out in 2005 and I was a huge YouTube nerd. But before that was out, there's some VHS tapes somewhere of me making these little videos, like talking about who knows what I was talking about, but it's always been a super big passion of mine for no reason. And this is important. 

So then I ended up doing a YouTube channel at when I was 11, that's this little bloop and blueberry thing right here. I was doing gaming videos like Minecraft and stuff like that. I made a bunch of other channels through middle school and high school. 

I had a music video business at 19 years old. And then I was a short form creator in the religious niche. If you search up Malvi underscore TX, you can see it. 

I still do it today. And I was doing that since 2022. And then I found this. 

So why is this important for what we're talking about here? I consistently had, there was some continuity to my journey, right? I was always in the trenches of content creation just for the sake of performing my duty. So I'll kind of extrapolate on that a little bit and tell you guys what that means in a second, shed some more light on that. But it was a constant, you know, like I wasn't there to have crazy views. 

You know, I wasn't there to have, you know, I wasn't hoping to get no views either. But it was never something I even thought about, you know, and the same thing I want to say too much before we get to these deeper slides, but the same thing goes with money. And I think it's really, really important whenever you're in this space that you are cognizant of that. 

Always. It's okay to strive for that stuff, but at the end of the day, you have a duty to perform. And for me, clinging onto the art, the artistry of what we do here is really, really important. 

As Jimmy would say, you know, just for the love of the game, you know what I mean? So, all right, let's get into it. Yeah. Once again, the constant action for the sake of action, no stagnation. 

I feel for years, but I kept on performing the actions. Let me open chat real quick. You remember when you had a Minecraft channel too? That's tight, bro. 

Minecraft was a crazy time back on PS3. That's what I was running. But yeah, so there wasn't necessarily a desire, like a need. 

It was like, it was as if content creation was a command from God. That's really how it felt. You know, that's really how it felt. 

And that's how I want you guys to feel about this stuff too. You have to, you have to, at the end of the day, you have to wake up every day and say, God woke me up for a reason. And I have to perform for that reason. 

And if you do that, like everything else will become a whole lot easier. It's so easy to get stuck up. So in Islam, they have a word for it. 

It's called the dunya. And basically the dunya is the world. It's taking you away from God, right? As you get closer to the dunya, you get farther from God and vice versa.

So learning how to stay out of that is very, very important. Yeah, Nick. Yeah, yeah, yeah. 

Okay. So because I stuck with it, I found this space that merged everything. The timing was never right for me until it was. 

And there's this, like, there's also this Hermosy quote where he's like, uh, there were a hundred, uh, people always used to doubt me for like trying to do business stuff. And they were always right. 99% of the time they were right until that 1% of the time they weren't. 

And that's what consistency gets you. And that's what detachment gets you. If every single day, if every single day you're just showing up and performing your duty, that 1% of the time is going to make up for that 99% of the time. 

And I can promise you that. So on my campaigns, I have a lot of newer creators. Um, we got some smaller campaigns running right now. 

It's a very close knit group. It's really cool because we got really new creators and we got some pretty seasoned creators. It's like not really anybody in between, but I think that's really, really cool.

And I love that because for you newer creators, I'm much more like want to help you guys succeed than help creators who have already hit and like make them richer. Right? Like it's so much more gratifying to, and Jimmy said this in his interview. Um, it's so much more gratifying to take somebody who's literally in the trenches and bring them to the light than it is to like find a business or whatever, a brand and just make them a million extra dollars. 

Right? So that's why I'm so passionate about what I'm doing here in the management game, as well as the creator, because I'm on both sides. I'm still here creating every single day. And it's so, so important that we have these foundational concepts together. 

So, all right, cool. Okay. So detachment, that's what we've been talking about pretty much the whole time. 

So I really like this quote right here. I don't remember who it's from. Uh, I think it's anonymous, but it is not that you own nothing. 

It is that nothing owns you. So I like this little visual right here too. Um, we don't got to get too deep into the visuals right here, but I want to talk about some of the top creators, what I've kind of recognized before they had huge breakthroughs. 

Um, all y'all know about judge. He broke so many records recently. He's an absolute killer. 

Um, and he had no real emotions involved. And this is what I noticed about judge in general, you know, like he's, he's not a very emotional person. He's a very stoic dude. 

Um, and, and before you had that major breakthrough, he was super humble. Like he was like, I didn't really expect that to do what it did, you know? And, and to be honest with y'all, like before I've had, when I came into CC, I felt it. You know what I mean? Like I felt hype about what I was doing. 

Don't get me wrong. But at the same time, it was like half of me too was just like, all right, we keep it pushing, you know? And this kind of goes in line with this little analogy that we have on the right here. This is something that really stuck with me that Matthew Palmer told me in our call on detachment for that evil goods campaign.

Y'all probably heard about it. Um, but it's as simple as whenever you order a package in the mail, you're not checking every single day to see whenever it's going to be arriving, right? You ordered the package. It's going to get to your house. 

I mean, maybe it's a crazy thing that you really, really want to have. Then maybe you're checking it every day, but on the average, if you order like, what is this? Where's that? I ordered this door lock. You know what I mean? I wasn't checking my phone every single day to see when this door lock got here.

And that's how your goals are. If you have intention and if you're consistently performing the action every single day, God is your delivery man. So that's very, very important. 

Um, let me see what else I wanted to say on here. Another person, Eddie, uh, super stoic dude on the evil goods campaign. I remember talking to him and he's like, so to use like brain rot terms, he's so nonchalant, bro. 

He's so nonchalant. Like he was putting up crazy numbers and it was never, it was never like a, a really like a, there was never tension about it. It was always just letting it flow. 

And that goes into a deeper analogy that I really, really live by what I accidentally drew something here on accident. Um, that goes to another analogy that I really, really live by. And I will show you guys in a second here, or it's actually the next slide. 

So let's look at that. All right. We're getting deep into some, uh, theological stuff a little bit here now.

Okay. But, um, oh, and I also wanted to say in that last slide as well, a lot of our creators in the hair gummy server are actual killers at that same kind of thing. Um, we got Kelly in there who's like, I think she has a degree in psychology. 

She's just like, absolutely. It's completely normal for her, you know? And a lot of it comes through in your tonality. A lot of it comes through in everything that you do. 

Like you can tell when somebody is genuinely in love with the craft and that's the space that I like in management want to be able to get every single person in my brand service, as well as literally every single person in CC. That's why I love being a CC coach. That's why I love doing this. 

Like on all sides of the game, I legitimately love this stuff. Like Jimmy knows I've been, I've been posting on my close friend's story about it. I legit, it gives me such gratification, but, um, okay. 

So money is like water, let it flow. What does that mean? So I got this little photo up. This is a depiction of Moses. 

Um, whenever he's leading the Israelites through the Exodus. So I'm not going to go too deep into the theological stuff in case y'all aren't super learned on the Bible, but, um, this is a super powerful analogy, of course, um, within the Christian, you know, milieu, this is understood. The rock is understood to be Christ and it kind of, and whatever, but I kind of want to put focus on the fact that it's as simple as so in the, in the book of Exodus, God tells Moses. 

So let me set the stage. So the Israelites are walking through the desert. They're, they're super thirsty. 

You know, they're super upset at Moses at God. Like, why is he treating us like this? The journey was supposed to take 40 days to 40 years at this point, you got to understand they're super vulnerable. You know, maybe some of their, uh, torment is justified. 

Maybe not. I don't know. It's not my decision to make, but at this moment when they're super, super like on their hands and knees are super desperate, God tells Moses, you see that rock over there, ask that rock for water and it will come.

And that is so powerful to me because you need to understand that money is the same way. Money is the same way. Just grab it out of the thin air. 

It's as simple as that. Like just ask the rock for water and it'll flow. Now the problem is, um, Moses struck the rock out of lack of faith.

So it's important to, that's another lesson that y'all don't become so tense in your striving for whatever your goals are that you don't allow that water to flow properly, that you don't allow that money to flow properly. So I want y'all like a cool visual that I have all the time is simply find the stream of money and stand in the way of it. So what does that mean in the content game? It means attach yourself to a style that you really resonate with. 

It means find a product that you really resonate with. Just simply stand in the way of that stream. The money is already flowing. 

You know what I mean? Like you're in an environment where you see money flowing every single day, a ton of it, a ton of it. It's, it's a constant, it must be in motion always. And that's we preach about abundance, which we preach about, um, you know, giving back to others, law of reciprocity, all that sort of stuff. 

I like to visualize myself drinking money and this sounds a little bit crazy, but I like to visualize myself drinking whenever I drink water, like this is money. You know what I mean? Like shout out to mountain Valley. Um, there is as many dollars as drops in the ocean. 

That's another analogy that I really like, but yeah, it's as simple as that. Y'all it's as simple as that. All right. 

Cool. Cool. Cool. 

Yeah. Judge. I appreciate you. 

All right. Let's get it. Let's get it. 

Y'all I'm hype. I love talking about this kind of stuff. Okay. 

So yeah, it's all, it's all for the love of the game. Y'all it's all for the love of the game. I genuinely love making content. 

So if you don't love making content, do it for the love of the game, do it for the love of the struggle, do it for the love of making something happen. Our real desire, I think as humans and our real purpose is to leave a lasting impact on those around us, on our family, on our friends. Um, our real fear that at the root of all fear is death. 

And by leaving an imprint on the world, we can evade that. So a lot of people outside of like our kind of space of thinking, think that money is evil. And it's because they haven't been in a position where they can use money to create a better world. 

And that's why I'm really, really passionate about what we do here in CC and all the brand servers that branch off of it is because we can use money as a vessel for creating a better world. It's really as serious as that. Like, I don't know if y'all listen to my voice messages that I sent in acts of kindness the other day, but my girlfriend got her nails done by this girl. 

She's named Chloe's and she, um, she did Grimes nails. So Grimes is a music artist. She has like three kids with Elon, the richest man in the world. 

And whenever the nail lady asked her for payment, she sent her a 20% tip on $200 nails. Now I want to ask y'all what any of us in CC being married to the richest man in the world, give a 20% tip. That's a very obvious fuck. 

No, excuse my language, but that's it's so crazy to me that we have, we have a, we have a mission to, we have a mission to perform y'all having this amazing abundance mindset, having this amazing conception of like giving back to others and seeing what that does in the world. We have a duty to ourselves, to the rest of the world to consistently show up every single day, because once we're able to collectively, uh, start to be in that position where we can help others, we will make a huge change. So that's kind of a branch off, but it's very important. 

So, um, something we do in Rosabella for detachment, like for the love of the game that I recently introduced, and I really love it is we have something called the spotlight. So you can, you can read it here, but I noticed that a lot of these campaigns, they really like to focus on GMB. Um, and I think that as a whole, like the servers under CC has started to recognize this too. 

Like in Brainista, we're starting to like be more product focused, talking about our experiences with the product, but something I really wanted to do in the Hair Gummy server that I recently started on is, uh, I wanted to simply shout people out for great things that they're doing in terms of their inputs. You know, outputs are important, conversions are important, and I'll never stray away from that. But at the end of the day, we all see the numbers, you know, we all see the GMB. 

So I started this to really start to recognize people for putting in the effort for showing up every day, asking for feedback, you know, dropping in their coaching chats, all y'all that are in my brand servers, I want you to know from the bottom of my heart, I never, ever, ever will be upset that you're asking for extra help. I never, ever, ever will be upset about having to review a video, drop every single video in the video feedback channel. If you need to, if you want to, um, and especially if you're, if you're, you know, you feel like you're struggling in any way, I do one-on-one calls with people.

And I've literally talked about just like, you know, a breakup or whatever else it is. I genuinely want to see you guys succeed in every single way. Like there's no part of me that's attached to a certain part of it. 

Like everything matters to me. So I really want to stress that for y'all. Yeah. 

Yeah. Yeah. All right. 

A hundred percent. Yeah. Rachel is one of my, one of the people in the campaign. 

She's a killer. We, she just recently had a spotlight as well. So, um, all right. 

I think that was it on this one. All right. So now we're going to get into just a little bit of theological stuff just to kind of tie things together. 

I know we got a really wide, you know, diversity of religious beliefs in CC. So I'm not here to, you know, the same thing I do with my content. Y'all can go see my page if you want, but I'm very, very neutral on all of this. 

The reason that I'm showing you from all these different perspectives is because I want to show you that detachment is found everywhere and simply showing up to perform your duty. That's outlined to you by God. It's everywhere. 

It's a universal principle. So with that being said, let's get into it. So I like this quote right here. 

Once again, I didn't put who it was. I don't remember if it's a actual person or not, but discipline isn't punishment. It's the freedom to achieve your goals through intentional action. 

Moment of silence real quick. I'm going to drink my water. That's something that meditate on them. 

So when we see, you know, these monastic practices in multiple religions and monastic means like monks. So we have, uh, you know, this, uh, Buddhist monk on the left. And we have these Orthodox Christian monks on the right.

When we look at monasticism, a lot of people think, you know, well, that's, that's stupid. Why would they put themselves away and, you know, not interact with the world? Like doesn't the, isn't it more important to, to preach to others? And it's like, at the end of the day, they're performing an action for God. And they're also performing an action for like the majority of the pop. 

Now it's not for everybody. Monasticism isn't for everybody, but it's not that they're, it's not that they're, you know, giving up their life. Like, yes, they are in a physical sense, but at the same time, they're giving themselves the discipline that is needed to be able to attain, attain a higher level of consciousness. 

So I really like to look to the wisdom of, um, I recently did a video where I talked with some Orthodox Christian monks on YouTube. It's a long form video. Um, and I, I love, you know, I love to really examine what that means. 

You know, somebody who's willing to give up their entire lives, but earthly lives for the sake of pursuing, you know, ultimate level of enlightenment or whatever you want to call it. So let's examine detachment through, uh, some quick parables. Okay. 

So the Christian perspective first discipline through, through faith. So we have this, uh, verse from Hebrews right here. Wherefore seeing, we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight and sin, which doth so easily beset us and let us run with patience, the race that is set before us. 

So just the explanation, trust that each step builds towards victory. The finish line is already predetermined as long as you make the effort to run towards it. So this goes back in line with that whole, um, analogy of the package, you know, just ordering the package. 

This goes in line with, um, another thing that, that, uh, Jesus says in the gospels, he says, ask him, ask the mountain to move. And you can, he says like, as long as you have faith, that's as small as a mustard seed, you can move mountains. And that is so powerful. 

Yeah. I'm getting kind of worked up. I nerd out over this theological stuff. 

I really, really love it. And I'm so happy that I can, uh, get on here and talk about this, man, just merging these spaces is so gratifying for me, but y'all, you know, how, you know, how tiny a mustard seed is. If you don't know how tiny a mustard seed, go look that up, bro. 

Go look that up. Oh, I'm taking y'all to church right now. Hey, it's, it's crazy. 

It's crazy. All right. Let's get into it though. 

Let me go through these other ones. So the Hindu perspective is also very interesting. So there's something called karma yoga. 

Now, a lot of people in the West, we have this understanding that karma is like the actions that you perform and like the bad deeds that, that kind of weigh on your spirit or the good things that you do. And it comes back to you, right? Law versus reciprocity, essentially is what we've come to understand about the Hindu perspective of karma in the West, but it goes much deeper than that. So if we look at karma as defined in the Bhagavad Gita, which the Bhagavad Gita is a smaller Epic within the much wider Mahabharata, which is a, it's one of the greatest Indian Epics of all time. 

It's actually not scripture, which is important to understand. It's something called the see there's the Smriti or the Shruti, I forget which one it is, but it's not considered scripture. This is stuff that's written as philosophical wisdom by the sages who came after the scripture. 

But anyways there is so the story goes like Krishna and Prince Arjun are on the battlefield. They're fighting this great war. It's called the Kurukshetra war. 

And Arjuna is very distressed about it because a lot of people that he's fighting against are from his family. They're from like, they're his friends. He doesn't want to fight this war.

And this is going to sound very dramatic y'all. But a lot of these Indian philosophical concepts, they're supposed to be dramatized. They're supposed to be a caricature. 

And with all religious texts, they're supposed to be dramatic because it's, then you think about your own life and you're like, well, if he could do that and it's a super, he's killing his own family member. Like what am I doing not showing up to make these videos every day? You know, what am I doing thinking that, oh, it's too much work to, to put my phone on the tripod and talk about this product that I really love and come back to this community that I really love. Like what is, what is our excuse? So I think that's, what's really powerful about this stuff. 

But anyways, Krishna, which is like a manifestation of God in this story, not important for what we're talking about here, but he tells Arjuna, he says, you have to perform the action for the sake of performing the action. So this is a word right here. It's called Teog. 

It's called it's renunciation. So renunciation of results. It's simply showing up, performing the action and renunciation of the results. 

So you're performing an action without any expectation whatsoever and why that's so powerful. I mean, we've kind of talked about the whole slideshow. Let me see here. 

I want to read through these comments. I bought my mom a bracelet of a mustard seed because she wants to manifest a house. That's amazing. 

That's amazing. You will give her the life she could. Yeah. 

A hundred percent, a hundred percent. Appreciate you judge. But yeah, so Krishna in the, in the war, and then there also is a story of Rama, which is also considered to be a manifestation of God in the Ramayana. 

So I actually have a copy right here, right here. And in this story, Rama is exiled. Rama is exiled by his father. 

He's exiled by his father because of one of his wives, his father's wives, just all of a sudden says, he's not going to take the throne. So he was set to take the throne because his father was about to die. He was set to take the throne, but all of a sudden he, one of his wives just says, cast him into the forest and something weird happened. 

You know, it's like, you expect somebody who's about to take the throne. They're really hype about it. Everybody's like, oh, we love you Rama. 

And we're super happy for you. And then all of a sudden it gets stripped away. You know, all of these dreams of power of money of whatever it is, it gets stripped away. 

And you expect somebody to, you know, be upset. You expect them to have at least a little bit of pushback. But what does Rama do? He says, okay, I'll go to the forest. 

It's what you command. It's as simple as that. Like he accepted that he accepted what it was and he was going to perform his duty.

And how powerful is that y'all? And not only did he accept his duty, but I also have that quote here at the bottom. He his dad's like, please just stay for one more night so I can see your face for one more night. Cause he doesn't want to exile him, but he's following the command of his wife.

He's like, please just stay for one more night. And what he says is super powerful. Y'all, this is super powerful on like always putting in the most effort that you can with your goals, who will grant me the virtue tomorrow that I shall attain by leaving now. 

It's like, who is going to give you the rewards of showing up today, tomorrow, nobody, every single day that passes. And you're not giving a hundred percent effort. You're losing the fruits of that labor.

That's super powerful. Y'all super powerful. I love that stuff. 

I love that stuff. Joshua says, this is wild. I asked God to speak to you this morning.

And okay. That's yeah. Yeah. 

I appreciate you. I appreciate you a hundred percent, a hundred percent Josh. All right. 

Let's keep it rolling. Let's keep it rolling. I love this stuff.

All right. The Islamic perspective. We got some Islamic folks in Sisi as well. 

So what does this mean? This means discipline through submission. That's kind of how I conceptualize Islam. So on those who believe and work deeds of righteousness, will Allah most gracious bestow love.

And there's also a verse from the Surah Al-Baqarah, which says on no soul doth Allah place a burden greater than it can bear. So what does mean is consistency in small acts builds reward without expectation. So I don't know if you don't know anything about Islam, but they have five daily prayers every single day. 

You know, a lot of them don't really stick to that, but those that do, it's these very small actions that build reward. And it's like showing up every single day and performing that action simply for the sake of performing that action. You notice that a lot of my Muslim brothers and sisters, they're just simply doing it because it's outlined in the scripture. 

And that's what I want y'all to take from this as well. It's as simple as you have a duty to perform as a creator, as a person, as a sister, as a brother, as a father, as a mother, whatever you may be, you have duties that you have to perform every single day. And that's some deep wisdom that we can take from everything that we're looking at here.

Okay. And then we got the Buddhist perspective as well. I believe this is the last one that I did put here, but it's disciplined through mindfulness, which is also very important.

So they have something called the noble eightfold path, which means letting go of distractions and honing into the present. Now I'll be honest, I haven't really gone deep into Buddhism. As of yet, I kind of just started my Dharmic studies, but from what I've understood, it's very, very powerful. 

It's a very individualistic, you know, devotion to kind of just clearing the mind, not necessarily clearing the mind, but acknowledging those bad thoughts, those good thoughts, whatever those thoughts may be and allowing them to pass. So it's very much detachment as well. You know, no matter what the thought may be, whether it's negative or positive, kind of acknowledging it and allowing it to pass.

Okay. So kind of circling back, really soft hand for y'all. Money does not exist.
