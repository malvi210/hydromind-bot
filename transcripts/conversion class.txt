How we doing, YabraMagic family? How we doing, how we doing, YabraMagic family? All right guys, so I noticed that there's a lack of talk on conversions, right? I think conversions are very, very important and they're not talked about enough and so if you guys have been getting views but then you've been struggling to make those views convert into sales, there's a few things that you want to be sure of, you guys. So we're gonna go through this little presentation that I made and if you guys have any questions, feel free to hit me up in your coaching chat. All right, so if you guys don't know me, I am Malvi, I am one of the coaches in YabraMagic and I want you guys to know that one good video can pay the bills, okay? This is my best performing video of YabraMagic to date on the left right here.

It is my scan angle, which by the time you see this, it may be kind of a washed angle but it has been the best for me and this one brought me home $5,000, one video, okay? And commissions and just to show you guys, it's not just with this brand, like I kind of do know what I'm talking about a little bit. This is another video from another brand that brought me home 3,000. Now, if we look at the stats here, this video with Yabra only did 289,000 views, has over 700 units sold.

This one with Evil Goods has 250,000 views, over 500 units sold. So more than two per 1,000. So what I consider a good conversion rate is like one sale per 1,000, that's what I'm happy with.

But two sales per 1,000, that's how you know that you're really converting well and that's kind of what I aim for actually. And so this is just to show you guys what is possible, okay? If you really put the effort into learning these things that I'm about to show you, this is gonna be a reality for you because imagine whenever you double up on these videos each month or triple up, you only need two of the video on the left here to have a $10,000 a month. So when you put in a perspective like that, it's really powerful.

So I want you guys to understand with this whole content stuff, you are a sales person first, okay? Virality means nothing if you cannot convert, okay? I've seen so many people that get millions of views and they'll get like two sales on it, okay? And you don't want that to be you. I've only had this happen one time where I wasn't getting at least one sale per 1,000 and it was the Spanish video and it's because it got sent to Mexico and not the United States and they don't have TikTok shop there. So that's another thing that I actually didn't put in this presentation.

I want you guys to, if you're having problems of your videos being sent to other countries, especially my Spanish creators, what I want you to do is go to your TikTok shop. So go to your TikTok studio. I'm kind of showing you my phone.

Go to your TikTok studio, go to the shop center right here, okay? And then you're gonna click on this little hamburger in the top right corner, okay? That little hamburger in the top right. We're gonna click on that. We're gonna go to privacy settings, okay? And then we're going to go to the very bottom, show content only in shoppable regions.

So you're gonna turn that on you guys. And that is how you can get around the fact that your videos are being sent to the wrong country. So I'm glad that I remember that so I can tell you guys that as well.

But yeah, virality does not matter if you're not converting. Doesn't mean shit. We're not here to, we are here to entertain.

We are content creators. Yes, I'm not denying that. And we do want views, okay? We do want views, but the reason we want views is to be able to have them open their digital wallet and pay you money, okay? And so that should be your first priority.

Yes, you need to know the skills of content. And I think it's a great resource. All the resources we have in CC are ready for that.

Fantastic, okay? But where I wanna bridge that gap for you is I want you to understand that you are a salesperson first, okay? If it goes viral and it doesn't convert, no point in it. Okay, so now that we got that out of the way, let me give you guys a basic sales copy format, okay? So I'll tell you guys, before I came into CC, I was doing content for like 10 years on the content side of things. And then I also currently still operate my own company called The Holy Cabinet.

My personal Instagram, I talk about religion. I've been studying religion for the past few years. And so with my organization, I help people in their spiritual journey.

Anyways, I sell things in that. And so this is where I do pull a lot of these same techniques that I used in selling, live selling even. I have sold live on live calls, okay? I've sold high ticket up to $2,500.

I've sold to one person. I've had one person give me $2,500. And so really, whenever I came into this space, I really wanted to be able to bring those same techniques of copywriting into this space, okay? Because it is very psychological, you guys.

You can't have any amount of gimmicks, any amount of tricks. All that's gonna work to get you viral, okay? But it's not gonna work to get you sales. Because whenever you involve somebody's livelihood, it's a whole different story.

So you need to make sure that your psychology is right, okay? And this is going to be one of the most basic ways that you can accomplish that, okay? This is the PAS format. So you're going to address your avatar with a problem. You're going to acknowledge that problem.

You're going to, and you don't have to do this indirectly. And in most cases, you won't do it indirectly, actually. Most of the time, you're going to be describing your personal story.

And so then that way, it's a lot more believable. But we'll get a little bit more into that further in the presentation. So firstly, highlight your audience's problem or need, okay? You're going to, you know, let's see, what can I think of as an example? I mean, with Yerba, it's very bottom of the funnel.

So I literally, in the beginning of my videos, after my hook, I'll say, if you have been struggling in the stomach department, and you just can't get rid of that extra pooch, or whatever you need to say to get around those weight loss violations, that is my addressing their problem, okay? Then, ideally, what you would like to do is you would like to agitate that problem. You would want to talk about how, you know, you tried all these things to help yourself get rid of that pooch. You tried, and this will vary, because I don't necessarily do this, right? As long as you put that problem into their mind, it's good.

If you can then develop that story, make them feel that position. So one that I've done with my girlfriend in my skit formats is I say, my girlfriend had her second child back in March, and she's really been struggling to get rid of that extra pooch after that. So this may put them in a similar headspace.

They may think, oh, I'm in kind of a similar situation. Then, we offer our product as the beacon of hope, okay? You want to be the beacon of hope. By the end of the video, you should have them begging you for the product link, okay? At the end of the video, when you do your CTA, yes, you want the CTA to be strong, but by the time you get to the CTA, they should already want it so bad that they have, in most cases for me, I will introduce my product halfway throughout the video, right? And then I'll usually even use the red arrow.

I'm very bottom of funnel with Yerba because I believe that this product is very good for that. But I will introduce my product halfway through the video because let's be honest, they're not watching the full video. I'll introduce the product halfway through the video, then I'll kind of backtrack a little bit because I don't want to be too salesy, right? It's important.

The psychology is very important. So I'll introduce the product, I'll step back a little bit and talk about my storyline, and then I'll reintroduce the product, say, hey, so if you've been struggling with any of these things, I'm gonna leave you guys a link right here. And you gotta be careful about how you do it because you really don't want to dip into that salesy avenue to where they don't believe you, you guys.

They really have to believe what you're saying. So let me try and think of a way that I could describe this for you. So with Evil Goods, it's a skincare brand.

So I'll say, one of the cheapest, most effective, and most natural ways to care for your skin that I have found is called beef tallow. And then I'll take a step back, so it's not as invasive. I'll take a step back, I'll say, I know you may think this sounds crazy or gross, and I'll even say something like, to make them more comfortable, make them build that connection more.

I thought the same thing. I would've called you crazy too. But then I'll show a before picture of me with the acne.

I'll say, I would've thought you were crazy too. But the results speak for themselves, you guys. I was struggling with acne for so long.

I tried all these different skincare products. I tried all these different diets. Nothing worked until I tried this.

The reason that beef tallow, then I'll go into the value, I'll go into the reason that beef tallow is so effective is because it can help to improve your skin's natural protective barrier, all these things. And then I'll come back to my CTA, which by now they're already sold, okay? If they want the product, they've already clicked on the link. But just to reaffirm that, to really push them more in that direction, you'll come back to your CTA after that, guys.

You wanna be mini-selling throughout the whole thing, right? The way that I'll backtrack with Yerba usually is, I'll say something about Yerba Mate and how people have used it in South America for its weight loss benefits. I won't say it like that, because violations, but I'll say something like that. And then I'll backtrack and say, my girlfriend has been using this, I've already told you guys this, and she's been able to see some amazing results.

And then I'll value bomb a little bit. I'll say, the reason that Yerba Mate is so effective is it releases GLP-1 in the same way that Zempik does. Maybe point at it if you want, like that's what I used to do.

The same way that Zempik does, but it actually doesn't even, it doesn't mimic GLP-1, it actually produces it, whereas the shot actually just mimics it. And so, I'll make more sense in their head. You want them to sell themselves, you guys.

They need to be selling themselves, so by the end of the video, they have already bought it or they're begging to be sold it, okay? If they haven't clicked your link already, which you should have your, I'm aggressive with it, I don't care. Because as long as you're casual enough, I will put my arrow, my red arrow, pointing at the product halfway through the video. Because one, people aren't gonna watch it all the way, and two, if you are selling it correctly, if you're natural enough, it won't come off as in your face.

Okay, like with that scam video, that's my best converting video thus far. And I think over half of the video is me selling you guys. You can't be afraid to sell.

The reason you're afraid to sell is you're worried about sounding salesy. And so, what you need to do is you need to not sell less, you need to modify the way that you are selling so it's comfortable, like you're a friend that's talking to them. So, PAS format, very important.

And then secondly, this kind of piggybacks off of it, is storylines. So, so important, if not the most important part of being a good salesperson, you guys. Listen, I will tell you from my own personal brand, The Holy Cabinet, and I actually have my hat right here.

The Holy Cabinet, okay? I've held live webinars for my community as well, okay? And I was speaking with my mentor, I was recognizing I wasn't selling as much as I should. And it was getting me down. What I had to do is I went back to the drawing board, I recognized that I was giving them a lot of information, okay, I was giving them a lot of information, a lot of educational stuff, because that's where I'm more logically oriented, you know, I'm not as emotional.

What I did was I went back to the drawing board, I described my own personal story of going through mentoring students, of, you know, recognizing that I wasn't addressing the emotional sides of things, of, you know, throughout my storyline, I'm talking about how painful it was for me. And that's why I say that this storyline ties back into that PAS. You don't have to necessarily say, you have a problem, you can say, I had this problem, I was working through it for so long.

You're, psychologically, you're in their head, okay? But you're gonna go back to that, this is what I did. I went back to my story, I said, I was feeling so upset because I couldn't connect with people of other religious beliefs, and it made me so upset, and I felt so ostracized, and all this, and then I also even added in a little bit of a flair where I said that the government was trying to censor me because I was getting shadow banned back in the day, talking about religions in the way that I do. And so I even made that, I was even selling, like, a movement, right? I was being silenced by, like, the Matrix, or whatever, that's why, and sorry to drop his name, but Andrew Tate, that's the reason that he is so successful in what he did, or he was so successful.

He created a movement, he created an entire ideology of the Matrix is attacking us, okay? Whether you think that he's a dickhead or not, it doesn't matter, he is a great salesman. Okay, and the reason for that is he has been able to develop an amazing storyline in people's heads. They see themselves in that story, and they want to achieve the same goal.

So, method acting, very, very important. You guys wanna get into the head of your target avatar, okay? For me, I have found most success with older women, okay? In both, in all markets. So, with Yerba Magic, I will do the weight loss angle, it's usually middle-aged women that go towards, are more interested in that, and just, you know, statistically speaking, you know, overweight men don't generally care, they don't care.

And then, overall, older women are gonna be the most ready to spend money, okay, statistically. And so, that's always been the target avatar I've gone after. Depending on your angle, it's gonna look a little bit different, even with evil goods as well.

I love my older women. I will do the anti-aging angle, okay, with my skincare product, and that's always been amazing. For me, it converts amazing.

Both of those screenshots that I showed you guys, the audience was over 70% women, and it was over, I believe as well, 70% women over the age of 55, okay? So, for me, that's been my target avatar, and I've really had to get into the space of what is going to move this middle-aged to a later age woman to give me her digital wallet and create that conversion. And so, once you find your target avatar, this becomes a lot easier, you guys. You can start to relate a story that makes more sense to them, okay? Because I will tell you guys, I had a video that didn't convert as well, and I forgot to put the screenshot here, but maybe I can find it on my phone for you guys.

Where is it at? Yeah, so this one right here is also a Yerba Magic video. I don't know if you're gonna be able to see that very well, but if not, I would tell you. So, yeah, you can kind of see.

It says 219,000 views and only 127 units sold, okay? So, for me, that's a very poor conversion. The reason for that is because I was a little bit aggressive in the way that I, so there's a couple factors, right? But you guys have to always break down your videos like this psychologically to understand all these little mechanisms that will cause your video to fail or succeed, right? I'm gonna plug in my computer so it doesn't die. But guys, with that specific video, I was doing this skit with my girlfriend where she's losing weight, and in my caption, I said something rash like she's looking so great now or something like that, and so it probably turned people off because they're like, ew, why is he talking about her weight like that? Obviously, it's a skit, but they don't know that, so they're like, ew, I'm not gonna buy it from this guy.

He's a dickhead, and so that's an important thing, and especially with my older women market because that's where I generally go, they're not gonna wanna see that, right? They're gonna particularly be offended by that, and then also, so I've seen a lot of people where their hooks will be very childish-oriented, right? So like sexual-related hooks, anything like that, any stuff that's inappropriate, it's going to obviously attract a younger audience because they're more immature, and they'll make fun of it. So you wanna stay away from that. You wanna understand, what I'm trying to tell you guys, your avatar, you need to adjust exactly for that avatar, okay, and there's very specific reasons as to why your videos are not converting with certain avatars, and if you're looking for a certain one and you're not hitting it correctly, your conversions will suffer.

So why do I have Star Wars on the screen right here? This is perhaps one of the most popular stories in human history, okay? We look at it now, and it doesn't seem that way but in retrospect, this will be a very, and I'm not even a huge Star Wars fan, I'm just acknowledging the facts here, guys. Star Wars will be looked at as a groundbreaking piece of work, okay? And so the reason why this is important is because think about Star Wars, and think about the sales that they've done, okay? Every day, think about how much money this company has made. Guys, there's people that buy Star Wars merch all freaking day.

Does Star Wars ever try to sell to them? Okay, sure, they may have advertising spend, but are they in their face trying to sell them merch? The answer is no, and the reason that they are able to be so successful is because their storyline is so strong. Okay, so I'm not asking you guys to write out some cinematic masterpiece for these little TikToks, but you need to make sure that you have a strong storyline because your storyline will do over 50% of the selling for you. So these two last slides I've showed you are very important as well.

Star, if you guys wanna do some real studying, get real nerdy with it, Joseph Campbell is somebody that George Lucas, I believe, was mentored under or at least studied his work. He developed a very clear outline for what makes a story good, and throughout history, all of these stories match the same framework that Joseph Campbell has built out. So the hero's journey is one of these frameworks.

So definitely look into that more if you guys wanna learn more about psychology of storylines and how that moves people. But you need to understand sales is an art, you guys. Sales is an art form.

You are an actor, and you must understand that, okay? You must understand that tonality, very, very important. Your tonality is going to decide whether or not you will convert. You can have the same exact script as another person, but if it does not have the correct tonality, it will not sell because they do not believe you.

This is all about trust, and this is all about conviction in what you're selling, but doing it correctly, okay? So very, very important, you guys. Very, very, very important. Okay, and this was supposed to be number four, but for some reason, I put number three with this as well.

And I wanna make sure that I don't have any more notes here as well. I don't think so. Let me see, though.

Yeah, no. So this last thing that I would wanna tell you guys, that's some sauce. Along with filtering your audience in general, if you are struggling with being sent to the wrong countries that don't have shoppable content, you also wanna filter all your comments, okay? So how you're gonna do this, you're gonna go to Settings, you're gonna go to Privacy, you're gonna go to Filter, and then Filter All Comments.

Turn this joint on, you guys. Listen, I used to always sleep afraid that my video would go viral. I would wake up to all these negative naysayer comments, and my video wouldn't have any conversions because there was all these people talking mess about my videos.

So I thought, let me go into Settings and look. And lo and behold, you can filter every single comment. And so what happens with this is you can very strategically filter those comments to only allow the good comments, okay? So you can approve only the good ones.

It's almost like if you had a product listing, which this is something that people do, and I used to do it on Amazon FBA as well. You just delete the reviews that are not four or five star reviews. Same concept.

This is social proof, you guys. How many times have you been about to buy a product, but then you open the comments and you see somebody say something, and you're like, ooh, I'm actually not gonna do that? Or vice versa. How many times have you almost not gotten a product, but then you've gotten in the comments and saw somebody say something like, guys, if you're wondering if this is actually worth it, just get it, you will thank yourself later.

How many times does that happen? So it's vice versa, guys. Comments are very, very important. I don't know about you guys, but I love comments.

I open the comments right away on every single TikTok. So nobody really talks about this either, but filter all your comments. Sleep in peace.

Guys, this will not affect your engagement whatsoever as well. I will tell you guys as well, the way that I kind of recognize this too, the way that I got the idea, was because whenever Mikaela first came in, which she's a goat, and I hope that she stays with us for a very long time. When she first came in, her video that did like 15 million views, she, on that account originally, she had this setting turned on and didn't know.

And so she had zero comments on a video that was already in the millions, and it looked kind of funny. But I was wondering if that messes with engagement. Obviously not.

She was doing millions and millions of views without those comments actually. And so the thing is, it will actually still affect your algorithm. It'll affect that video getting pushed.

Even if you don't approve that comment, it will count as a comment on the TikTok end. So that does count as engagement, you guys. So that is my last piece that I had there.

And yeah, that's it for my presentation, you guys. I hope I didn't miss anything. If you guys have any other questions, please, please feel free to at me in your coaching chat, and make sure that you guys are showing up for these calls on Sundays, you guys.

I really wanna help everybody in Yerba Magic win. This is an amazing brand. It has so much potential.

At the time I'm filming this, this is January 15th. So if we're not putting the fries in the bag in four days, and you're coming in, make sure that you guys take advantage of this amazing opportunity. It is a low-key brand in Creator's Corner, but we have a lot of 100K monthers that are taking notice and are coming into the chat, okay? Shout out Sydney as well.

She's in here now, and hopefully she starts crushing it soon. I know she will. So that is all I had for you guys.

Thank you guys so much for trusting me to help you as a coach. And if you guys have any questions whatsoever, please feel free to reach out. Thank you, guys.
